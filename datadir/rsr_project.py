The school has a student capacity of more than 500 children with 12 teachers. The school has a low fee structure that is affordable to local families. The school does not have adequate infrastructure to provide basic facilities such as separate urinals for girls and boys and drinking water.  Similarly the school has no specific focus on environmental education in the school curriculum to create awareness and knowledge among children.', u'Under the project, one waterless environmental urinal block will be constructed with 6 private urinals - three for boys and three for girls between the ages of 5 and 14.

Similarly, two urine diverting ecosan toilet units with waterless urinals for male and female teachers will be established using the same environmental systems and approaches. In addition to this, a specific curriculum on environment, sanitation and hygiene will be  developed with the help of experts and professionals. Since the school has agreed to include the specially designed curriculum in the school programme, the teacher will be provided with training by a professional/expert reagarding teaching methodology on environmental water & sanitation and hygiene related issues aimed at young school children.', u'This project has been developed as per the real need of the school and after a series of dialogues with the school authority. Although the school authority realises the need to provide basic amenities and sanitation facilities with privacy to the school children (especially to the girls), the school is not in a position to provide such provisions due to low fee structure. Since the ratio of girls to boys in  the school is 40 girls to 60 boys, the girls mainly face sanitation related problems during school time. Once the facilities and provisions are created, the school will take care of the facilities and maintain the facilities. Because, the school building has been constructed on private land that belongs to the proprietor cum manager of the school, the ownership will remain with the school authority only. Similarly, the school has more female teachers in comparison to male teachers. So on the whole the project will largely benefit the girls and female teachers. Since the project is based on environmental and ecological concepts and approaches \u2013 closing loop, the outcome will be more sustainable in terms of environment and ecology. In addition to immediate benefits, the project will be the pilot at least in Delhi to incorporate curriculum among young children in the early stages of education. ', u'Not Available', 0, u'']
