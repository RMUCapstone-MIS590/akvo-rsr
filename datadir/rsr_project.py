The school has a student capacity of more than 500 children with 12 teachers. The school has a low fee structure that is affordable to local families. The school does not have adequate infrastructure to provide basic facilities such as separate urinals for girls and boys and drinking water.  Similarly the school has no specific focus on environmental education in the school curriculum to create awareness and knowledge among children.', u'Under the project, one waterless environmental urinal block will be constructed with 6 private urinals - three for boys and three for girls between the ages of 5 and 14. The toilet block will be constructed with provisions for collecting urine in a tank. The stored urine will be transported to farmers for recycling and use in agriculture instead of urea. Similarly, two urine diverting ecosan toilet units with waterless urinals for male and female teachers will be established using the same environmental systems and approaches. In addition to this, a specific curriculum on environment, sanitation and hygiene will be  developed with the help of experts and professionals. Since the school has agreed to include the specially designed curriculum in the school programme, the teacher will be provided with training by a professional/expert reagarding teaching methodology on environmental water & sanitation and hygiene related issues aimed at young school children.', u'This project has been developed as per the real need of the school and after a series of dialogues with the school authority. Although the school authority realises the need to provide basic amenities and sanitation facilities with privacy to the school children (especially to the girls), the school is not in a position to provide such provisions due to low fee structure. Since the ratio of girls to boys in  the school is 40 girls to 60 boys, the girls mainly face sanitation related problems during school time. Once the facilities and provisions are created, the school will take care of the facilities and maintain the facilities. Because, the school building has been constructed on private land that belongs to the proprietor cum manager of the school, the ownership will remain with the school authority only. Similarly, the school has more female teachers in comparison to male teachers. So on the whole the project will largely benefit the girls and female teachers. Since the project is based on environmental and ecological concepts and approaches \u2013 closing loop, the outcome will be more sustainable in terms of environment and ecology. In addition to immediate benefits, the project will be the pilot at least in Delhi to incorporate curriculum among young children in the early stages of education. ', u'Not Available', 0, u'\n']

The project will be implemented in North Showa administrative Zone of Amhara Region in Ethiopia in six small villages (Goshe Bado, Angollela, Mio Meda, Moya Mangult, Gift and Chimbre) and a local elementary school located around Debre Birhan town. ERHA intends to implement the project in partnership with ""Developing Families Together (DFT)"", an NGO working towards poverty reduction for improving the quality of rural life of the poor in Ethiopia. In collaboration with the ERHA, DFT will work to alleviate the problems of the community through:\r\n\u2022 Harvesting rainwater by building 35 tanks which will improve the access to safe water. Depending on the season and the number of people in the household, rooftop gutters draining into a 5,000- liters\' capacity rainwater tanks could meet between 25%-75% of a household\u2019s water needs during the rainy season and several dry months that follow;\r\n\u2022 Providing 35 latrines and educating on hygiene and sanitation issues. The disadvantaged segment of the population (mostly children and women) will be engaged and educated in health and sanitation issues. This will build the capacity of community on health and sanitation;\r\n\u2022 In addition, the capacity of DFT will be strengthened through trainings on water and sanitation related topics.\r\n\r\nOther goals:\r\n\r\nWater collected through rainwater harvesting prevents long queues at the springs, it saves time and backbreaking work for women and children and it is especially useful for older men and women who cannot go to the rivers or springs. Not having to fetch water means improved school attendance for children and more income generating activities for women. As water quality is usually better compared to existing sources, it is also expected to improve health of users. \r\nRainwater can also be used for other purposes, such as agriculture i.e. using it to grow nutritious food. Furthermore, it can be used to water domestic animals. With the strict attention to community awareness raising and education, the replicability and future cost sharing arrangements, the expected results and impacts could be by far greater.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status:\r\n\r\nCurrently, women and children in the project area spend hours each day collecting water for productive use and drinking. Most months, water is collected from a local river. When the river runs dry, they get it from unprotected springs and wells. Often these sources are miles away from their homes, and unfortunately, the water is frequently contaminated. The impact of unsafe water has devastating effects on all users. Incidences of child mortality and morbidity are on the rise and children are often sick from diarrhea. Each episode hinders a child\u2019s growth by lowering their appetite and reducing their calorie and nutrient uptake. Repeated infections can lead to increased malnutrition, which in turn increases susceptibility to further infection. Persistent diarrhea and severe diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, jeopardize children\u2019s healthy development. \r\nAccording to local statistics, more than 50% of the children are suffering from chronic malnutrition and more than 10% from acute malnutrition. Local sanitation customs further impede access to safe drinking water. Unsanitary conditions and practices at the household level, such as the absence of sanitary latrines, unsafe waste disposal and unhygienic behavior in childcare and food preparation, create a dangerous environment with health risks.', u'"The sustainability of the anticipated project is briefly highlighted hereunder:\r\n\u2022 Technological sustainability: appropriate care taken in identifying and applying the different RWH technologies, research support, imparting knowledge (building awareness, participation and skill training), effectiveness of identified technologies (design review /durability), availability of access routes to improvements with the advent of access to research information through ERHA; \r\n\u2022 Community management and ownership: Community organisation and training through the various capacity building inputs/activities and facilitation of communities\u2019 active involvement would enlarge the local commitment and sense of ownership. Based on earlier experiences of managing RWH systems through local water management committees, ERHA is convinced that the long-term sustainability is ensured effectively. In case of unforeseen problems, the local water management committees can directly contact ERHA or DFT for assistance. \r\n\u2022 Economic and financial sustainability: the RWH systems provided by the project require minimal provisions, with comparative advantage of requiring almost no running cost involved for their continued use. Once the RWH structures are built to good standards, the need and frequency for repairs is very limited. If any, these should be repairable with local materials and skills.\r\n\u2022 Ecological sustainability: there is no any negative impact on the environment as a result of developing the RWH structures and accompanying technologies (like gutters and filters). Promotion of RWH contributes in forestalling such major ecological problems as overexploitation and dropping groundwater levels as well as the environmental pollution caused from applying high-tech water supply facilities. In addition, the excess rainwater from catchments usually percolates into the ground to recharge the groundwater. ', u'N/A', 0, u'']
