More so, the caste and gender discrimination in Karnali Zone is comparatively high resulting in lack of access of women, Dalits and marginalized people to resources, opportunities and decision making processes from social, economical and political perspectives. To add more to the woes, the situation in Karnali Zone was further aggravated due to the Maoist movement which culminated into a fierce armed clash with the State resulting in serious human rights violation with a death toll of nearly 700 people, abduction and disappearance of more than 300, torture and detention of more than 800 and displacement of more than 7000 people.']

In Asia, SNV provides capacity development services to government, non-government and private sector organisations in Nepal, Vietnam, Bhutan, Laos PDR, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Pakistan as well as to a number of regional organisation and networks. SNV seeks to achieve its overall strategic goal of poverty reduction and good governance by focussing on: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tImproving the access, coverage and quality of basic services\r\n\u2022\tIncreasing production, income and employment opportunities for the poor\r\n. \r\n\r\nProgramme priorities in Nepal\r\nSNV began working in Nepal in 1980 and since then our role has evolved from an implementing agency to a capacity strengthening service provider.  After years of experience on the field, SNV has acquired extensive technical know-how and an in-depth understanding of the social and cultural undertones of Nepal.  However, SNV Nepal does not implement development projects itself; rather it works to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of key local organisations and government bodies.  This way, implementation is placed in the hands of local actors. This SNV characteristic contributes to sustainable and nationally owned impact on development leading to lasting poverty reduction, as well as fulfilling the MDGs.   \r\nSNV Nepal currently works in five sectors which have been prioritised and aligned with the Government of Nepal\u2019s Development Plan.  They include:\r\n\r\nImproving basic services:\r\n\u2022\tWater, Sanitation and Hygiene\r\n\u2022\tRenewable Energy (biogas, improved water mills, others)\r\n\r\nIncreasing production, income and employment opportunities:\r\n\u2022\tSmallholder Cash Crops (orthodox tea, cardamom, apple, others)\r\n\u2022\tForest Products (timber and non-timber forest products, pro-poor carbon funding)\r\n\u2022\tPro-poor Sustainable Tourism\r\n\r\nTotal staff of SNV Nepal is around 65, of which 45 are professional advisers (international and national).

Bottled water that is being imported from European countries is responsible for a great deal of CO2 emissions and is, on top of that, 400 to 3000 times more expensive than tap water. And that while The Netherlands have the best drinking water in Europe, that is what tests performed by the European Commission have shown.  \r\nJointhepipe.org wants to promote the most sustainable water there is: tap water. We therefore designed a series of carafes and water bottles that can be filled with tap water. This way it is no longer necessary to purchase those polluting plastic throw-away bottles in the future. The profit of every carafe or bottle sold is being donated to one of our many water projects in Third World countries. So, drink only tap water from now on.

They needed access to the most appropriate technologies, to outside funding and to expertise, none of which were available within the traditional Rotary structure.\r\n\r\nMost important, it became apparent to Rotarians and to potential funding partners that the original Rotary model - many small projects with limited community involvement or empowerment - would not have the impact many Rotarians were seeking.  Nor could the supply-driven focus of many clubs achieve any significant degree of sustainability.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill this mandate WASRAG\u2019s goals are to:\r\n\r\n- Create awareness among Rotarians of the importance of conservation and sustainability and of local and global water issues;\r\n- Raise awareness of the need for, and benefits of, safe water and sanitation;\r\n- Develop a compendium of best practices to ensure sustainability and cost-effectiveness;\r\n- Distribute information on appropriate technologies for supplying, conserving and purifying water and for sanitation;\r\n- Build and encourage mutually beneficial relationships with other organizations, corporations, agencies and NGOs sharing common water and sanitation related goals;\r\n- Identify alternative sources of financing to complement The Rotary Foundation e.g. private foundations, corporations, government agencies;\r\n- Assist in identifying and formulating programs and projects that will promote sustainability; Implement mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of projects;\r\n- Create a network of experts accessible to Rotarians and Rotary clubs;\r\n- Provide training and education on water/sanitation technologies and issues;\r\n- Facilitate the exchange of information via a web-based forum a forum;\r\n- Establish a bibliography of relevant materials, references etc.;\r\n- Give information on relevant conferences;\r\n- Act as advocates on water issues;\r\n- Support Rotary clubs seeking financial and/or technical assistance;\r\n- Foster \u201cCenters of Excellence\u201d on water/sanitation;\r\n- Operate a web-site and produce regular newsletters or bulletins;\r\n- Implement procedures to ensure sustainability and cost-effectiveness;\r\n\r\nWASRAG was authorized by Rotary International to carry out this mission in February 2004 and was officially launched on World Water Day, March 22nd, 2007 at the National Press Club in New York.  Since then it has facilitated well over 200 projects\u2014helping clubs find partners, helping to ensure sustainability, stressing the importance of a needs-driven approach, developing best practices, encouraging a holistic, integrated approach in which water is not the end in itself but is rather the means to a better life and livelihood in the community.  \r\n\r\nMost importantly it links water and sanitation to personal hygiene, better health, empowering the community (especially women), irrigation and agriculture, education and literacy and, ultimately, child mortality. \r\n']

At that time the country was called Rhodesia after Cecil Rhodes who had an ambition to build a railway line from Cape to Cairo and to develop the hinterland economically. With the coming of Independence from Britain in 1980, the country's name changed to Zimbabwe and a few years later, the capital city's name was changed from Salisbury to Harare. The city remains the capital and economic hub of Zimbabwe. In Harare there are now ten Rotary Clubs.\r\n\r\nUp to June 1997 the country formed part of Rotary International District 9250 but at present is one of the four countries of District 9210. Previously the Kingdom of Swaziland and the northern and eastern parts of the then province of Transvaal in South Africa were part of the District. Now the District encompasses Malawi, Zambia and the northern half of Mozambique in addition to the whole of Zimbabwe. This covers a large area of sub-equatorial Africa. So the District Governor annually has a daunting task to visit all the Clubs in this large District.\r\n\r\nAt the time of redistricting there was disappointment at not being able to meet annually close Rotarian friends from Swaziland and South Africa at future assemblies and conferences. However it has created opportunities for further friendships with Rotarians in less developed neighbouring countries in Southern Africa and provided almost unlimited opportunities for service.\r\n\r\nLike the club which sponsored the formation of RC of Harare more than seven decades ago, the Johannesburg Rotary Club, the first on the African continent, the average age of membership continues to be the highest in R I District 9210. Because of this, the club has a goodly number of members now in retirement, so steps continue to be taken to induct younger members. The weekly luncheon attendance by the 70s plus age group, however, remains regular. Their wise counsel on the service committees particularly, based on their experience with major projects many initiated by them in earlier days, is much appreciated and where possible these 'old timers' continue to support the ongoing ones. Membership in general of course realizes that there is the continuous need for an inflow of new younger members to maintain the dynamism for which the club is so well known.\r\n\r\nThe RC of Harare boasts of having provided no less than seven District Governors. Membership is largely drawn from amongst the ranks of business and professional leaders within the city, individuals who have over the decades made significant contribution towards the development of Zimbabwe."]

They needed access to the most appropriate technologies, to outside funding and to expertise, none of which were available within the traditional Rotary structure.\r\n\r\nMost important, it became apparent to Rotarians and to potential funding partners that the original Rotary model - many small projects with limited community involvement or empowerment - would not have the impact many Rotarians were seeking. Nor could the supply-driven focus of many clubs achieve any significant degree of sustainability.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill this mandate Wasrag\u2019s goals are to:\r\n\r\n- Create awareness among Rotarians of the importance of conservation and sustainability and of local and global water issues;\r\n- Raise awareness of the need for, and benefits of, safe water and sanitation;\r\n- Develop a compendium of best practices to ensure sustainability and cost-effectiveness;\r\n- Distribute information on appropriate technologies for supplying, conserving and purifying water and for sanitation;\r\n- Build and encourage mutually beneficial relationships with other organizations, corporations, agencies and NGOs sharing common water and sanitation related goals;\r\n- Identify alternative sources of financing to complement The Rotary Foundation e.g. private foundations, corporations, government agencies;\r\n- Assist in identifying and formulating programs and projects that will promote sustainability; Implement mechanisms to determine the effectiveness of projects;\r\n- Create a network of experts accessible to Rotarians and Rotary clubs;\r\n- Provide training and education on water/sanitation technologies and issues;\r\n- Facilitate the exchange of information via a web-based forum a forum;\r\n- Establish a bibliography of relevant materials, references etc.;\r\n- Give information on relevant conferences;\r\n- Act as advocates on water issues;\r\n- Support Rotary clubs seeking financial and/or technical assistance;\r\n- Foster \u201cCenters of Excellence\u201d on water/sanitation;\r\n- Operate a web-site and produce regular newsletters or bulletins;\r\n- Implement procedures to ensure sustainability and cost-effectiveness;\r\n\r\nWasrag was authorized by Rotary International to carry out this mission in February 2004 and was officially launched on World Water Day, March 22nd, 2007 at the National Press Club in New York. Since then it has facilitated well over 200 projects\u2014helping clubs find partners, helping to ensure sustainability, stressing the importance of a needs-driven approach, developing best practices, encouraging a holistic, integrated approach in which water is not the end in itself but is rather the means to a better life and livelihood in the community.\r\n\r\nMost importantly it links water and sanitation to personal hygiene, better health, empowering the community (especially women), irrigation and agriculture, education and literacy and, ultimately, child mortality.

If the billions of rural poor only have a bush knife as tool, then the water pump they may need should be made with only that bush knife and resources available to them. \r\n\r\nIf these billions of rural poor would be motivated by the quality of an adequate design made available to them they would put this information to practice. \r\n\r\nHow with such limited means crucial quality can be achieved is mission and task of Foundation "Demotech, design for self-reliance". Demotech finds such solutions by tenacious research in its laboratory and during field work, Experience gained is shared with for whom it matters in its website, video-reporting and published papers.\r\n\r\nThe Demotech Rope Pump design from 1975, first field tested in 1976 in Burkina Faso, embodied many of the required qualities for unsupported self-sustained use at the Bottom of the Pyramid. Demotech and others have reported where, when and how this happened. \r\nPopularity of the Rope Pump design induced some NGO\'s to partly subsidized providing of this water pump, often with a more centralized manufacture with industrial means. In practice this led to the same failure of other industrial produced hand pumps due to difficulty to maintain and find spare parts while numbers of pumps realized where a fraction of set targets.\r\n\r\nOn our website you will find many projects that are designed with a similar approach. Examples are, Hydraulic Rampumps, Furniture, Administration system, Sanitation, Transport, Engineering for the Bottom of the Pyramid work shops, etc. \r\n\r\nAgain Demotech sees it as its task to generate, field test and publish a design for a hand driven water pump that fulfills all criteria for rapid self-reliant and self-sustained application required for reaching Millennium Development Goals. Design targets are set higher then in 1975. Functional performance to be equal or better then existing hand pumps to depth of 70 meters. Cost within the reach of the extreme poor (<1$/p/day). Made with local materials and tools only, according to local craft practice. Self-explaining setup and construction limits need for training to demonstration and peer-to-peer spread of knowledge. \r\n\r\nBench marks of success will be immediate un-invited, un-subsidized copying of the water pump where demonstrated and needed. A bench mark that takes more time to set is development of income generation by manufacture and local selling of the rope pump. A third bench mark is the occurrence of change in life-style because of easier access to water. \r\n\r\nRe-design is Demotech\'s job. Demotech explores and puts to practice the possibilities of a different approach to development, which takes into account the social construction of technology and critically deals with the process of their innovation and implementation. Demotech treats people as creators of development and active collaborators in the process of shaping technology.\r\n\r\nAll the work that it takes to realize such bench marks describes best how our organization Demotech functions and performs: all but easy going!']

Een betere kwaliteit van leven biedt een beter toekomstperspectief. Dit wil de Stichting doen door in samenwerking met de lokale NGO's (Niet Gouvernementele Organisaties) projecten op te zetten, uit te voeren en te begeleiden. De doelgroep bestaat uit mensen met een handicap en sociaal \u2013 maatschappelijk zwakkeren, zoals weeskinderen, bejaarden en hulpbehoevenden.\r\n\r\n\r\nWERKWIJZE\r\nDe hulpvraag moet duidelijk vanuit Sri Lanka komen. Zowel hulpvragen van locale NGO's, Nederlandse organisaties als informatie en verzoeken van onze locale medewerkers worden onder de loep genomen. We richten ons op de aanleg van drinkwater en sanitaire voorzieningen. Daarnaast willen we bijdragen in de eerste levensbehoeften in de ruimste zin van het woord.\r\n\r\nDe meeste projecten bevinden zich op het platteland in een straal van ongeveer 100 km rondom de stad Kurunegala. De projecten worden vooraf ter plekke getoetst en begroot door projectbegeleider Jan. Onder beheer van de locale projectuitvoerder Chaminda Fernando worden deze projecten met de bevolking uitgevoerd. Voortdurend is er intensief overleg en project begeleiding vanuit Nederland met onze projectuitvoerder. Elk project wordt afgesloten met een eindafrekening. Om de continu\xefteit te waarborgen zorgen we voor een blijvende nazorg door bij een volgend bezoek de tehuizen opnieuw te wijzen op hun verantwoordelijkheden met betrekking tot bijvoorbeeld het onderhoud van de pompen, watertanks, sanitair, hygi\xebne enz. De projectbegeleider bezoekt de projecten regelmatig en biedt daarnaast ter plekke directe hulp aan noodlijdende mensen.\r\n\r\nOnze Stichting kent geen overheadkosten: het werk wordt verricht door vrijwilligers die administratie- verblijf- en reiskosten uit eigen beurs betalen."]

Building of class rooms for basic education is a very important one. In this project we are building toilets in the schools of basic education. The funding actvitity starts with children of the elementary education in Eindhoven Walk for Water. The amount they collect is doubled by three organisations Brabant Water, Waterschap de Dommel and the Gemeente Eindhoven. Sometimes there are also gifts from other people, like the Ambassador of Sudan in The Hague and a former ambassador for Holland in Khartoum. After that action the total amount is doubled by the Aqua for All organisation. In our case it is used to build toilets. \r\n\r\nThere is also a project to help families improve their income by cultivating vegatables and selling or changing them for other items. The next year they continue with this activity as they are taught by students of the Agricultural University to save the seeds to be able to continue this income generating activity. If the children of these families do not go to school they are sponored for one year by the project. After that first year we find that the children continue going to school due to the improved financial position. We also notice that the diet of the family changes as they have access now to fresh vegetables. This project has added some more activities for families to improve the family income: caring for 15 chickes, which provide eggs for selling but also for use of the family of course. Another activity is to care for a milky goat and to sell part of the milk.The nex step was to provide a number of improved males to have off spring for the goats after the milk can no longer be produced. So now the young animals are given to another family so they can also produce milk.\r\nTwo new items were introduced in 2009: Planting shade and fruit trees inside the area of the house to produce fruit and to improve the conditions by providing shade in the living ares.\r\nThe other innovation is to provide gas units for women working in the markets to make coffee and tea to sell and food for the people who are working on the market all day. The gas is about 40% cheaper than using charcoal for cooking and it also saves the need to cut trees.\r\n\r\nWith the support of SPEG another twinning between organisations was started by the Digitale Stad Eindhoven (DSE) and Gedaref Digital City Organisation (GDCO). DSE sent several shipments of second hand refurbished computers to Gedaref to be used for training purposes in Gedaref. Now 700 computers are in Gedaref and used for educational purposes in schools during the normal school day and for adult education in the evenings. Also a number of telecentres have been established were people can work on the computers if they want to use them for study or for internet use.  \r\n      ']

WOTR's initial mandate was to develop the capacities of various stakeholders for the Indo-German Watershed Development Program.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that wars in the future will be fought over water. As and how this precious resource gets scarcer, our survival is what will matter more than all the technological and economic developments put together. Finally, it will be man and nature once again \u2013 like being back to the basics. \r\n\r\nIn fact, if you were to undertake a tour of the drought-prone regions of India, you would realise for yourself how water and its availability becomes the prime concern of people staying in a \u2018dry\u2019 area. Women and children walk for miles in the blistering sun to be able to get just a pot of drinking water. Men dig deep into the hard ground to be able to locate a brackish water resource. Taking a bath or washing clothes is considered a luxury that no one in such regions can afford. Parched throats yearn for a drop of water. And the arrival of a water tanker can even lead to ugly fights.\r\n\r\nFarming, a traditional occupation in most villages of India, can become an unreal notion in the face of such water shortages. People therefore begin to migrate to cities in search of livelihoods. Some villages turn to nothing more than landscapes of ruins. Some turn into the final abode of the sick and the elderly who wait for the merciful hand of death.\r\n\r\nThese then are the realities that led Fr. Hermann Bacher, a Jesuit priest, and Crispino Lobo to establish the Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR) in 1993. Fr. Bacher had committed himself to change the lives of the rural people handicapped by the shortfall of opportunities and resources in their villages. Crispino Lobo gave up bright career prospects and instead decided to work for the impoverished. Under them, WOTR organised and capacitated villagers to regenerate their watersheds so as to trap whatever little rain that fell in their area and use it for farming and personal use.\r\n\r\nWith its head office at Ahmednagar, WOTR has, over the years, turned barren landscapes into forests. And this magic has happened not just because of the technical guidance and funding that it has provided to several villages across Maharashtra but for the fact that it works with a holistic picture in mind. WOTR gets villagers committed to watershed development. It convinces them about the need for collective participation and voluntary labour. WOTR gets the women population involved too in the process of decision-making and governance.\r\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s more. With its objective of reducing poverty in villages, WOTR looks at the bigger picture that involves providing educational inputs for children, entrepreneurship opportunities for women, preservation of the environment and creating such a self-sustaining ambience in every village that none of the villagers would want to go to the overloaded cities to eke out their living.\r\n\r\nSince 1993, WOTR has also added two more organisations viz. Sampada Trust and Sanjeevani Institute of Empowerment and Development (SIED) to focus on specific activities such as entreprenuership, micro-credit and implementation. In present times, WOTR has moved on from just watershed development to including the effects of climate change and what needs to be done about this big issue. It has ventured into rural renewable energy and community based rural tourism.\r\n\r\nFrom Maharashtra, WOTR has also spread its reach and work to villages in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. In statistical terms, WOTR has so far implemented 198 watershed projects in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan covering an area of 142,000 ha (6/09).\r\n\r\nWOTR grew of a fortuitous confluence of factors that arose in India and Germany in the early 1980\u2019s. There was also a growing realisation that despite huge amounts spent on poverty alleviation programs, the absolute and relative number of people living in poverty remained stubbornly constant. Both sides realised that despite their best efforts, something critical was missing and had to be addressed if a difference was to be made.\r\n\r\nIn 1987 the German government launched a special study in India - the Indo German Pilot Program (IGPP) - to assess the effectiveness of official assistance in fighting poverty. Both governmental and non-governmental development agencies involved in policy-making, funding, implementation and research on the German and Indian sides participated. Findings highlighted that aid was most effective when it reached the poor directly, but it had a spread effect when the government ably supported it. Following the German Parliament\u2019s resolution to support by way of grant aid any program that addressed poverty reduction, environmental regeneration, self-help and women\u2019s empowerment, Fr Hermann Bacher, who was involved in the entire IGPP study, conceived of a large scale community-driven program for poverty reduction, centered on regenerating the environmental space of villagers along watershed lines in Maharashtra known as the Indo-German Watershed Development Programme (IGWDP). \r\n\r\nGiven Fr Bacher\u2019s credibility and experience, he was successful in convincing both the Indian and German governments to accept, approve and fund the project. The first official agreement was signed in 1989 and the Indo-German Watershed Development Programme (IGWDP) was launched in late 1992.\r\n\r\nWhen the IGWDP began, there were barely any capable NGOs who could take up the programme. In 1993, it was decided by a group of prominent NGO leaders to set up a new organisation to cater to the capacity building needs of the IGWDP and to create a movement for participatory watershed development in India. And that\u2019s what led to the birth of WOTR on December 20, 1993."]

Through structural development projects Dorcas lends support to help local communities become self-sustaining and less dependent on foreign aid. The beneficiaries of the projects are the really poor and oppressed. Special attention is given to women and children. These projects focus on five specific areas: Agriculture, water supply, health care, housing, and income generating projects. 30% of the Dorcas projects focus especially on children. \r\n\r\n2. In social projects Dorcas gives a helping hand to those that are poor and vulnerable in former communist countries and Africa, giving them food and clothing. \r\n\r\n3. A number of the above projects are funded through financial sponsorship. This means that donors ('sponsors') pay a monthly amount of money for a particular child, family or 'granny' in one of the project countries. \r\n\r\n4. In relief and rehabilitation operations Dorcas serves to lessen the effects of disasters (both man-made and natural) by providing food, clothing and medical assistance; refugees are assisted in resettling. \r\n"]

In 2009, Hope Alive Uganda was registered officially in the Netherlands.  Hope Alive Uganda operates in Kisozi, Kamuli district.  Hope Alive Uganda supports orphans concerning education (school fees, school materials, school uniforms), runs an HIV/AIDS programme, sets up income generating activities and runs other health programmes to improve the circumstances of the community.  Hope Alive Uganda also wishes to set up Hope Alive study centre.  \r\n\r\nStaff/board\r\n\r\nHope Alive Uganda is led by two directors, one in Uganda and one in the Netherlands.  All in all, 10 people work for Hope Alive Uganda.  Hope Alive Uganda has a board.  Also, it has an HIV/AIDS trainer.    Hope Alive Uganda also works with volunteers: students from the Worldschool have worked or are still working on producing materials concerning HIV/AIDS and malaria tasks which will be used by teachers and pupils at the schools in Kisozi, volunteers through the 1 % club have worked or are still working on tasks such as the building of the website (which is completed now), drafting a plan for setting up an ict centre (still running), a toys project for the children in Kisozi (which is completed now), fundraising (still running).  Every now and then, Hope Alive Uganda also works with volunteers through Nabuur and UNV online volunteering service.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\n\r\nHope Alive Uganda runs several projects in Kisozi:\r\n\r\ngoat project \r\n\r\n38 orphans registered with Hope Alive Uganda have received a goat. The orphans can breed the goats and sell their offspring, as well as sell the milk.  In this way, the orphans will be able to afford their school fees, school uniforms and school materials.   The project can sustain, because the first female offspring is given back to Hope Alive Uganda which will then pass this one on to another orphan.  20 more goats will be handed out in september.  The project is monitored by Hope Alive Uganda, which checks the conditions of the goats regularly.\r\n\r\nchicken project \r\n\r\nAn income generating project started in March 2010.  In this project, needy women and men will participate in order to improve their circumstances.  Profits from the project will go to the men and women prarticipating in this project and to Hope Alive Uganda, through which new investments in other projects can be made.  Eggs will be sold at the market.\r\n\r\ncrafts project \r\n\r\nThe crafts project is an income generating project for two women's groups in Buwenda and Kakindu, Jinja.  By producing beads, necklaces and others crafts, women earn a small income which helps to sustain themselves.  A market is created in the Netherlands (the Wereldmuseum, Afrikamuseum, Tropenmuseum and museum Volkenkunde support the women's groups) and the crafts are sold in a boutique in Nevada city, USA, thanks to volunteers working for Hope Alive Uganda through the 1 % club.\r\n\r\ncycling-to-school project \r\n\r\nThe cycling-to-school project is an income generating project for the youth in Kisozi that can be conducted thanks to Cycling out of poverty, a Dutch organization, and includes a training programme, a repair shop for bicycles and students are given the opportunity to buy a bike on credit.  The aim of the project is partly to reduce school drop outs by giving those students that need to come from very far to go to school the chance to buy a bike on credit. Cycling out of poverty and Hope Alive Uganda are working on an exchange program for students from Kisozi and students from the Netherlands.\r\n\r\ntailoring project \r\n\r\nThe tailoring project is an income generating project for women.  From April on 2010, 10 women receive a training in Hope Alive Uganda's tailoring studio in the centre of Kisozi and they will make school uniforms, clothes, curtains, blankets, sheets, bags, reusable pads for women/girls etc. and sell those.  The women have already started making school uniforms.\r\n\r\nsponsorship of orphans\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, fundraising activities take place to support orphans who can't afford to pay their school fees.  Yet this is a programme that still needs to expand a lot more.\r\n\r\nbeds project \r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, fundraising activities are held to buy beds, matrasses, blankets and sheets for those children that sleep on the ground.  This is done through collecting the deposits on returnable bottles by a local supermarket and private funders.  Until now, 14 children have received a bed, mattrass, blankets and sheets.\r\n\r\nhiv/aids seminars/workshops\r\n\r\nHope Alive Uganda runs seminars/workshops concerning HIV/AIDS prevention and trains the youth from schools in Kisozi and its surroundings to be peer educators, who can then continue this at their schools.  Also, Hope Alive Uganda holds seminars for the community itself.  Hope Alive Uganda has the ambition to set up an aids information centre and cooperate in that with the local health centre. NCDO will support Hope Alive Uganda in 2010 - 2012 with this.\r\n\r\nBorehole project \r\n\r\nHope Alive Uganda worked with GGNET to raise funds for the building of a borehole.  This campaign ran throughout 2009-2010.  Apart fromt he building of the borehole, Hope Alive Uganda has held a safe water campaign to teach the community about the importance of safe drinking water, hygiene, the hygienic use of latrines etc.  Impulsis has funded one third of the costs of building the borehole and has become Hope Alive Uganda's support partner with Akvo.  Hope Alive Uganda hopes to raise the remaining amount with Akvo to complete the fundraising for the building of the borehole.\r\n\r\nApart from these projects, Hope Alive Uganda has done several other things or will do numerous other things: it ran two  \u2013 one in November 2009 and one in April 2010 \u2013  eyecamps through which more than 1200 people had their eyes checked by doctors and were given a free pair of glasses.   Thanks to private funders, Hope Alive Uganda provided 240 orphans with a mosquito net in January 2010 and will provide another 66 orphans with a net in August 2010.  About 1500 teddy bears/stuffed animals were collected by Dutch school children and were distributed to children in Kisozi, Uganda in April 2010.    Hope Alive Uganda has plans to set up Hope Alive study centre.  Furthermore, Hope Alive Uganda is partnering with Sharing Schools. \r\n\r\nPartnerships\r\n\r\nHope Alive Uganda has established several partnership with other organisations, mainly Dutch organisations:\r\n\r\nthe 1 % club (Netherlands) \u2192 Hope Alive Uganda raises funds through the 1 % club for the goat and chicken project.
