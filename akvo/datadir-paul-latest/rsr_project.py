This is the time to scale up the sales with an increased sales force, but also to diversify the product portfolio by installing a bottling line and set-up sales of vitamins as additives.', u'Executive summary of the project:\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s water crisis is one of the major challenges of our time. The lack of water is strongly linked, and negatively impacted, by Climate Change, rapid population growth, soaring energy prices and the financial crisis. As a consequence, the impact of diarrheal diseases for children is bigger than the impact of HIV, Aids, Malaria and tuberculosis combined.\r\n\r\nThe Winddrinker Holding will commercialize a wind driven desalination technology developed by the Delft University of Technology, the Winddrinker. With this technology people in developing countries get access to cheap and affordable water. A windmill is directly coupled, mechanically, with a Reversed Osmosis desalination technology. The system eliminates the use of, expensive, batteries; wind energy is virtually stored as fresh water. This reduces the capital and maintenance costs and reduces environmental impact while increasing the overall efficiency and reliability of the system. A software program has been designed to optimize the Winddrinker for each specific location.\r\nBased on wind and water data this program designs the cheapest system given a specific output.\r\nOur mean strategy to bring this technology on the market in developing countries is through stimulation of local entrepreneurship. Local entrepreneurs can set-up franchise businesses following our unique implementation triangle. Beside access to the Winddrinker technology they get access to capital and education. Revenues from the franchises for the Holding will be created primary through shareholders dividends and interest on loans. \r\n\r\nThe global market is extremely large. From small Islands in South-East Asia to extremely dry areas in Africa, as long as there is a lack of fresh water and sufficient wind and salt water, the Winddrinker offers a competitive solution. Our mean initial focus is on east Africa, one of the world\u2019s areas that is the hardest hit by drought. East Africa alone already has a market for more than 850 Winddrinkers.\r\nTo demonstrate the Winddrinker and the implementation triangle we will start-up a local pilot franchise in Berbera, Somaliland (an autonomous and safe region in North Somalia).\r\nThis local franchise will operate under the name Malao Waters. The severe water stress, favorable wind conditions and our well established network make this area a favorable area to start. The system design for Somaliland, will produce 60.000l a day. A local entrepreneur will sell the water initially in bulk at the pump at a competitive price of 0,5 Eurocents/litre, After an additional investment also bottled jerry cans of 20 litre will be sold. The investment in the windmill can be earned back easily in 5 years while making a positive net profit. When paying the shareholders Malao Waters can still save enough money to buy a second windmill within 5 years.\r\n', u'Imagine a system that converts salt water to drinking water by nothing more than wind energy. Salt water and wind are available for free. \r\n\r\nThe Winddrinker produces clean drinking water by desalinating salt water. The process is entirely powered by wind energy, resulting in a zero emission solution. The movement of the windmill is mechanically transferred to the desalination pump. The system is more efficient than current windmill-desalination systems, as no energy is lost in conversion to electricity. \r\n', u'As mentioned before, the scarcity of clean drinking water links to all kinds of other economic, political and social problems.\r\nAnd water is scarce. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is abundant evidence that fresh water resources are vulnerable and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate change. Water scarcity in East Africa is the worst\r\n\r\nKenya, Djibouti, Somaliland all have enormous water scarcity and water quality problems. We can be assured that this situation will only become worse.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Republic of Somaliland\u2019 was created on 18 May 1991. The new Somaliland encompasses the territory of the former British protectorate which borders Djibouti, the Gulf of Aden, Ethiopia and Somalia. Somaliland broke away from the former Italian protectorate Somalia.\r\n', 0L, u'Complete Business Plan is available upon request.\r\n\r\nFunding requested is for phase 1 only.

It is expected that the construction of the filter systems will start mid-September.', u'In short the NIAS (NOTS Integrated Arsenic Solution) project consists of the selection, adaptation and implementation of arsenic removal technology on village level in rural areas in Bangladesh. PRIDE and NOTS strive to use available technology to construct filter units that provide 150 liters of clean drinking water per day; a capacity suited for approximately 6 households of average 5 people.\r\n\r\nThe key elements of NIAS are:\r\n\xb7 A filter system that will be installed next to an existing shallow tube well, which produces 150 liters of clean water per day in a user-friendly way.\r\n\xb7 This filter system will be used by on average 6 families with on average 5 persons each. \r\n\xb7 During 1 year, starting six months before the filter systems are installed in a community a so called awareness builder will be employed. His/her task is to make the people in the community aware of the arsenic problem and to make them enthusiastic for NIAS.\r\n\xb7 Per community (where 16 \u2013 18 filter systems will be installed) 1 person will be employed for 15 hours per week. This person will maintain the filter systems and will test the water of every filter system every three months.\r\n\xb7 Every three months the water will be tested for arsenic content and for bacteriological content. Before installing the filters all tube wells will be tested in a similar way in order to select the best tube wells for the project and to mark the other ones as \u2018non-drinking water\u2019.  \r\n\xb7 Each family will pay 35 Taka per month for using the filter system. This amount will cover all costs: salary of the awareness builder; cost of the filter system (depreciated in 4 years) & installation; salary of the maintenance man; and the cost of the test kits.\r\n\xb7 The arsenic that accumulates in the filter will be regularly collected by PRIDE. NOTS and PRIDE are looking into possible applications of this waste stream for example in brick making or tarmac production.\r\n\xb7 Due to the relatively small filter units (6 families only) and the surplus of tube wells available in every village, the project can be easily extended when population increases. Construction workshops and the presence of a local maintenance person enable the village to install additional filter systems together with PRIDE.\r\n', u'PRIDE and NOTS strongly believe that the NIAS project will be effective and sustainable because:\r\n\xb7 The filter system will be effective in cleaning water. NOTS and PRIDE will develop an effective system by combining the best elements of existing filter systems.\r\n\xb7 NIAS is much more than a technical solution. NIAS builds awareness and NIAS is a continuous intervention.\r\n\xb7 NIAS is economically sustainable; the 35 Taka (\u20ac0.34) per family per months covers all the costs.\r\n\xb7 NIAS is using the market mechanism in an optimal way: when one has to pay for a service or product, one will be critical that the service or product is doing what it is supposed to do. \r\n', u'In 1993 the Government of Bangladesh became aware that a substantial part (about 27%) of the tube wells is contaminated with arsenic. In the district around Jessore, where PRIDE is based, the contamination is more severe. An estimated 50% of the shallow tube wells is contaminated with arsenic.

The school does not have adequate infrastructure to provide basic facilities such as separate urinals for girls and boys and drinking water.  Similarly the school has no specific focus on environmental education in the school curriculum to create awareness and knowledge among children.', u'Under the project, one waterless environmental urinal block will be constructed with 6 private urinals - three for boys and three for girls between the ages of 5 and 14.

Similarly, two urine diverting ecosan toilet units with waterless urinals for male and female teachers will be established using the same environmental systems and approaches. In addition to this, a specific curriculum on environment, sanitation and hygiene will be  developed with the help of experts and professionals. Since the school has agreed to include the specially designed curriculum in the school programme, the teacher will be provided with training by a professional/expert reagarding teaching methodology on environmental water & sanitation and hygiene related issues aimed at young school children.', u'This project has been developed as per the real need of the school and after a series of dialogues with the school authority. Although the school authority realises the need to provide basic amenities and sanitation facilities with privacy to the school children (especially to the girls), the school is not in a position to provide such provisions due to low fee structure. Since the ratio of girls to boys in  the school is 40 girls to 60 boys, the girls mainly face sanitation related problems during school time.

The project will be implemented in North Showa administrative Zone of Amhara Region in Ethiopia in six small villages (Goshe Bado, Angollela, Mio Meda, Moya Mangult, Gift and Chimbre) and a local elementary school located around Debre Birhan town. ERHA intends to implement the project in partnership with "Developing Families Together (DFT)", an NGO working towards poverty reduction for improving the quality of rural life of the poor in Ethiopia. In collaboration with the ERHA, DFT will work to alleviate the problems of the community through:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Harvesting rainwater by building 17 tanks which will improve the access to safe water. Depending on the season and the number of people in the household, rooftop gutters draining into a 5,000- liters\' capacity rainwater tanks could meet between 25%-75% of a household\u2019s water needs during the rainy season and several dry months that follow;\r\n\u2022 Providing 17 latrines and educating on hygiene and sanitation issues. The disadvantaged segment of the population (mostly children and women) will be engaged and educated in health and sanitation issues. This will build the capacity of community on health and sanitation;\r\n\u2022 In addition, the capacity of DFT will be strengthened through trainings on water and sanitation related topics.\r\n\r\nOther expected results:\r\n\r\nWater collected through rainwater harvesting prevents long queues at the springs, it saves time and backbreaking work for women and children and it is especially useful for older men and women who cannot go to the rivers or springs. Not having to fetch water means improved school attendance for children and more income generating activities for women. As water quality is usually better compared to existing sources, it is also expected to improve health of users. \r\nRainwater can also be used for other purposes, such as agriculture i.e. using it to grow nutritious food. Furthermore, it can be used to water domestic animals. With the strict attention to community awareness raising and education, the replicability and future cost sharing arrangements, the expected results and impacts could be by far greater.\r\n\r\nCurrently, women and children in the project area spend hours each day collecting water for productive use and drinking. Most months, water is collected from a local river. When the river runs dry, they get it from unprotected springs and wells. Often these sources are miles away from their homes, and unfortunately, the water is frequently contaminated. The impact of unsafe water has devastating effects on all users. Incidences of child mortality and morbidity are on the rise and children are often sick from diarrhea. Each episode hinders a child\u2019s growth by lowering their appetite and reducing their calorie and nutrient uptake. Repeated infections can lead to increased malnutrition, which in turn increases susceptibility to further infection. Persistent diarrhea and severe diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, jeopardize children\u2019s healthy development. \r\n\r\nAccording to local statistics, more than 50% of the children are suffering from chronic malnutrition and more than 10% from acute malnutrition. Local sanitation customs further impede access to safe drinking water. Unsanitary conditions and practices at the household level, such as the absence of sanitary latrines, unsafe waste disposal and unhygienic behavior in childcare and food preparation, create a dangerous environment with health risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'"The sustainability of the anticipated project is briefly highlighted hereunder:\r\n\u2022 Technological sustainability: appropriate care taken in identifying and applying the different RWH technologies, research support, imparting knowledge (building awareness, participation and skill training), effectiveness of identified technologies (design review /durability), availability of access routes to improvements with the advent of access to research information through ERHA; \r\n\u2022 Community management and ownership: Community organisation and training through the various capacity building inputs/activities and facilitation of communities\u2019 active involvement would enlarge the local commitment and sense of ownership. Based on earlier experiences of managing RWH systems through local water management committees, ERHA is convinced that the long-term sustainability is ensured effectively. In case of unforeseen problems, the local water management committees can directly contact ERHA or DFT for assistance. \r\n\u2022 Economic and financial sustainability: the RWH systems provided by the project require minimal provisions, with comparative advantage of requiring almost no running cost involved for their continued use. Once the RWH structures are built to good standards, the need and frequency for repairs is very limited. If any, these should be repairable with local materials and skills.\r\n\u2022 Ecological sustainability: there is no any negative impact on the environment as a result of developing the RWH structures and accompanying technologies (like gutters and filters). Promotion of RWH contributes in forestalling such major ecological problems as overexploitation and dropping groundwater levels as well as the environmental pollution caused from applying high-tech water supply facilities. In addition, the excess rainwater from catchments usually percolates into the ground to recharge the groundwater.

Families not served by the composting latrine project rely on traditional facilities; these involve digging a shallow pit (~50 cm deep as beyond that one reaches the granite rock). These are used until they fill up (every 3-4 weeks), then the \u201ctoxic\u201d contents are shallowly buried elsewhere on the site, with serious pollution run-off on the steep slopes of the mountain.', u'This project will work with locally trained builders to build approximately 24 additional dry composting toilets on the site. Each toilet is used by an average of 12-18 people.   All latrines are built with local materials and are coherent with the architecture of the historic site (bricks, bamboo, tiles).  The latrines consist of two alternating pits and are sized to ensure that the pits have a full year to compost before the contents are removed.  The cabin over the composting pit is built so that it can be used as a shower (solid footplate), thereby meeting another concern of users who did not previously have shower facilities.   Urine and shower water are diverted into a soak pit and do not enter the composting pit. Compost that is used from the pits is expected to be used on gardens and, especially, fruit trees on each property.  \r\n\r\nEach latrine has a locally made (pottery) water reservoir so that users are encouraged to wash hands after toilet use.   \r\n\r\nConstruction of the latrines is expected to take place over a period of 7 months, so as to \u201cfit\u201d with other project activities, which include rehabilitation of tile roofs on vulnerable historic houses. Most of the latrine construction will take place during rainy months when roofing is not possible, thereby assuring adequate quality control and supervision of all activities.\r\n \r\nAcceptance of these toilets is high in the community, as indicated by the waiting list. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the turn-around of this historic site, which was previously so dilapidated, filthy, and stinking that no one wanted to live there.  Latrine construction is vital not only to protecting the health of the residents and their neighbors, but also to restoring the cachet of the site and making it appealing both for middle class Malagasies to return and invest, but also as a site of interest for tourism.  \r\n\r\n', u'Most toilets built under this program will be multi-family facilities in order to reduce the cost per user.

These medical students run a camp program for children of the Old City around the themes of sanitation, hygiene and nutrition.  The need for toilet use and handwashing are key themes covered in the camps which are attended by more than 300 children a year.

We also conduct annual workshops on these themes at the local elementary school and give individual training on use and maintenance to each family who benefits from a latrine.  \r\n\r\nWe have trained a team of residents to change the footplates and remove the compost at the end of the cycle.

This water source is controlled by the community, who do not see supplying the school as a priority. It forces school children to manage without water, which causes poor sanitation especially for girls.

Rainwater harvesting has been common practice in Thailand for as long people can remember and is a very familiar way of collecting drinking water. However, the quality of the water is very bad by the time people start drinking it. The water contains a lot of pathogen bacteria\u2019s such as ecoli and coliform that cause diseases.\r\n\r\nThe rainwater collected at the schools is stored in large concrete tanks. The tanks are not sealed well; so small animals are able to get into the tanks. We saw maggots, mosquito larvae\u2019s, cockroaches and even lizards floating around in the tanks. Together with the dirt from the gutters and the droppings of birds and cats that flush down from the roof, it makes the so called \u201cdrinking water\u201d a very dangerous mixture.\r\nChildren drink straight from these tanks by opening a small faucet close to the bottom of the tanks. In order to have safe drinking water at the end, we should start with the beginning, the place where the water enters the tanks. It's also very important that we collect and store as much water as possible to survive the 7 month dry season. To do so we will renew all gutters and rainwater pipes that are leading to the concrete tanks. The next step is reparation of the concrete tanks, as the tanks are often cracked and leaking. The lids of the tanks are renewed with fortified concrete when necessary.\r\n\r\nThe manholes on top are completely sealed of so no animals can get in. We install a whole new underground piping system, leading to the enclosure where the filters are situated. The filters are based on an established technology that uses silver-coated balls to kill all pathogenic bacteria. The filter system is called a \u201crain purification center\u201d and was developed by a Dutch company named \u201cAquaest Europe\u201d which is specialized in rainwater harvesting systems.\r\n\r\nOnce the water has passed the filters it is clean and safe to drink. The water is collected in a clean water buffer tank which also contains a floater with silver-coated balls. An attractive drinking place is situated close to the clean water tanks where the children can tap their cup of safe water. Faucets we use are self-closing so no water will be spilled. Next to the faucets that deliver safe water, a green smiley sticker is put which makes it clear for even little children to understand that this is the right place to get their drinking water. Faucets that don\u2019t deliver clean water are marked wit a red sad face sticker to make it clear to the children that this water is not safe. A poster is placed at the wall above the drinking place which shows with drawings what the meaning of the stickers is.\r\n\r\nTest results at schools that already have the clean water system show that the water in the clean water tanks stays free of pathogenic bacteria; principals of those schools confirm fewer children get sick.\r\n\r\nOther results:\r\n-Lower number of ill children in the area.\r\n- Growing awareness of health benefits in surrounding villages by spreading the word.\r\n- Providing local unemployed villagers with construction, maintenance and \u201cextension\u201c jobs.", u'By placing 6 goats at the schoolyard we generate finance for maintenance. Their offspring will be sold by HOAT and this money will be used to replace the filter cartridges when necessary. Other ideas of the school\u2019s principal and teachers to generate money to replace the cartridges will be considered as they show up.\r\nHOAT stays in control of the system and the school\u2019s principal signs an agreement in which he declares to cooperate with HOAT in order to keep the system functioning.\r\nSmall maintenance of the system will be carried out by the school caretaker.\r\nHOAT will be able to perform maintenance that the school is not able to take care of. HOAT will continue to monitor the school\u2019s system which is possible by having \u201cHOAT people\u201d present in the area. 4 schools have been equipped already and more will follow, creating multiplying and effects, and also ensuring sustainibility.', u'Dutch Foundation \u201cHOAT\u201d started to install rainwater harvesting systems in Thai schools in September 2007. So far 4 schools are equipped and around 1000 children have access to safe drinking water at their schools. Children drink collected rainwater witch stands still for months in large concrete tanks and which is full of pathogenic bacteria. The system we place cleans the water and kills pathogenic bacteria. 20% of the system is imported from The Netherlands and has been tested extensively. 80 % is produced locally. Tests in the working field in Thailand until now show the water stays clean and free of pathogenic bacteria. Teachers state that fewer children get sick since the systems are installed.

An old plastic can and ball point pen tube and lid provides the hand washing system which uses Seso, a naturally occurring soap plant with antiseptic properties. Pump Aid provides the elephant toilet concrete slab which uses just one bag of cement and incorporates a urine diversion channel which lengthens the life of the pit, with urine diversion enriching a compost pit behind the toilet that can be used as a fertilizer.  When the pit is full the slab can be removed and reused, making it a toilet for life. A fruit tree can be planted into the old pit, making use of the rich soil.\r\n\r\nTo improve health further and provide a source of income generation alongside every pump, a nutrition garden is established, which is irrigated using water from the pump.

The key people in the Panchayats, women and village leaders in the Pani Samitis will be identified and hence forth the responsibilities and inputs will be shared with this critical group. This group of leaders will go through structured trainings conducted by Hriday and the Socio-enviro cell of sahjeevan, and the Panchayat cell of KMVS.\r\n\r\nThe two years of the project period will be divided into short campaigns of four to six months, in which a sub theme of water will be taken up, like self sufficiency, good governance and management, good quality and sanitation etc. The sub theme will be taken up for developing an understanding, knowledge creation and implementation during that period of time. The different resource groups and partners will focus the sub theme topic with their respective leaders to create synergy and bring different perspectives and experiences forward. While the panchayat, gender and technical groups will focus on their leader groups, the mass media will take their messages and views to the public at large through the radio, \u2018ujjas\u2019 magazine, street plays, posters and lok diaras. The community radio uses local youth trained as reporters and the musicians and singers of the district develop stories and songs borrowing from the culture and tradition of the region. The rural women\u2019s collective of an adjoining taluka, Mundra has been publishing a magazine called \u2018Ujjas\u2019, they will add a supplement on water for the next two years and increase its circulation to cover all the villages of Abdasa. A special focus has been planned for the children and youth of the region. The learning will also be shared in seminars and meetings for the government and other stakeholders in the district and state.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that a seminar will be conducted at the end of each sub theme. This is an approach that has been tried and developed for implementing projects on a larger scale by these partners, in earlier programmes like the Drought Proofing Programme coordinated by Abhiyan. A technical office will be setup in Abdasa that will be run by \u2018para water technicians\u2019. These are youth from the region that will be trained by ACT to be qualified to identify aquifers, develop plans and proposals, prepare costs and estimates, and hand hold implementation. ACT has already trained 64 such youth in the district, some of whom will join this office, and still others will be trained under this programme. The panchayats can avail the services of these youth on payment to help them prepare and implement their plans.\r\n\r\nThe taluka will be divided into 4-6 clusters whose leaders will meet regularly to share their experiences, learn from one another, and build a healthy competition amongst them selves. The senior women\u2019s collective members of Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathan will take responsibility for involving and motivating the women, in each village, to take active part in the decision making and management of the drinking water system.\r\n\r\nThis year all the villages of the taluka are going to have their elections. The new panchayat will be trained in procedure using the implementation of the drinking water programme in their village. It will also use this programme to build transparency of finances, information and decision making in the panchayat. The panchayat will pass a resolution setting up the pani samiti and vest it with the powers to implement the project, collect taxes and manage the drinking water scheme. Efforts will be made to ensure that the responsible women of the village are in the pani samitis, besides those in the panchayats.\r\n\r\n', u'1.\tThe Pani Samitis and their project for the village will be approved in the gram sabha. It is mandatory for the Panchayats to appoint Pani Samiti\u2019s. This lends legal validity to these institutions to some extent.\r\n2.\tThe financial routing takes place between WASMO and the Pani Samiti. This gives greater ownership over management and planning of the project at the grassroots \r\n3.\tHouseholds will contribute at least 10% of the implementation cost of the project and the regular water tax for operation and maintenance. This will also ensure ownership to a large extent.\r\n4.\tPresence of para water technicians (parabs) at the village level and their collaboration with Pani Samiti\u2019s will ensure continuous inputs and tackling issues related to technology/management\r\n5.\tThe project is based on areas where groundwater aquifers have been mapped. Hence wells, recharge pits will yield optimal water. Norms on use established at the village level will ensure that conflicts related to competing use will be addressed accordingly (through institutions and norms). Norms on use will also lead to sustainable use of water.\r\n', u'Drinking water scarcity in Kachchh is a historical phenomenon. Being geo climatically one of the harshest regions of India, in every decade it experiences only 3 normal and 1 above average rainfall years. Such low rainfall (annual average of 312 mm  ) is primarily because of its geographical location as it forms a contiguous land mass with the Arid and Semi Arid regions of Thar Desert in Rajasthan. Hence \u2018complete failure of rains once in 3 years is a part of the cultural knowledge for Kachchhis\u201d . An analysis of 110 years of rainfall data  corroborates that low rainfall has been a leitmotif in the Kachchh landscape.\r\n\r\nKachchh experiences the highest air temperature in the month of May with temperatures ranging from 40\xb0C-45\xb0C. High temperature coupled with dry weather causes high evaporation from surface water, which measures up to 8 feet per annum. The quantitative constraints are further compounded by a qualitative one. The Kachchh landmass owes its geo morphological existence to a marine environment which results in largely saline groundwater reserves. Hence poor surface water resources coupled with unavailability of potable groundwater has left its meagre annual rainfall as Kachchh\u2019s only renewable natural source of water.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, communities in Kachchh have developed coping mechanisms over the years. Both demographic and livelihood strategies are optimized according to natural landscape limits. Low population density (33 persons per sq km ), small and scattered settlements and animal husbandry as a major occupation are all geared towards such an end. Potable water was usually sourced from small ponds and tanks. However, locally devised techniques of tapping sweet water was done through virda\u2019s. \u201cVirda\u2019s\u201d or shallow dug wells tap potable water at upper reaches of an aquifer (1-4 metres) as deeper down (<4m) one discovers saline water. Rainwater harvesting through ponds and lakes has also been a traditional process. Usually well off individuals in earlier times constructed such catchment structures out of charity. They served a key purpose in attending to livestock water requirement. Incidentally the livestock human ratio in Kachchh is 1:0.89  and pastoralism has always been a sustainable livelihood option.\r\n\r\nNeed for food sufficiency in post independent India led to large scale State supported irrigation initiatives. This tilted a considerable section of the populace towards agriculture. Surfeit of irrigation projects were sanctioned and diesel operated pumps entered the region. Understandably, this weakened the resource base. Meanwhile concern for public health due to high mortality from water borne diseases, ushered in government entry into drinking water. Piped drinking water was introduced as a result through Regional Water Supply Schemes (RWSS), which were heavily dependant on available groundwater.  Of the total 948 villages in Kachchh, 787 were deemed \u201cno source\u201d . As of now 113 villages are covered under RWSS and 126 under the Integrated Water Supply Scheme (IWSS) .  However, inefficient management and rapidly dwindling groundwater levels affected sustainable supply. The Narmada Water Board Drinking Water Pipeline Project (a.k.a N.P) was a corrective step which rationalized the use of Narmada water for dependable water supply and promised coverage of entire Kachchh district. The N.P project also witnessed an institutional delivery mechanism as Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB); Gujarat Water Infrastructure Limited (GWIL) and Water and Sanitation Management Organisation (WASMO) were introduced at meso and micro levels to manage and deliver. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, such large scale techno bureaucratic solutions assumed the absence of local water sources and traditional water wisdom of local communities. As later studies revealed, \u201call N.P project villages had (read have) local sources of water supply, with many villages having more than one source\u201d . Disregard for traditional coping mechanisms for water stress saw a steady decline of virda\u2019s and ponds. Need and application of sustainable management of groundwater also witnessed a downturn. Simultaneously, the N.P project also witnessed serious bottlenecks. The entire project was to be completed by the end of the 10th Plan but severe shortage of funds halted its progress. Alongside, delivery through regional pipeline schemes was impeded due to irregular supply of electricity, poor maintenance of pipelines and breakages and thefts . The most critical issue, as pointed out in studies , is that of inter and intra village equity in distribution.  \r\n\r\nIn such a context, an alternative solution was the need of the hour for communities in Kachchh. Search for the same led to a multi institutional decentralized solution space under the aegis of the Pani thiye panjo programme. \r\n', 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-06-11', None]

In 2007 both Agriterra and ZijActief Noord-Zuid-Holland have planned a mission to WOPD to monitor the implementation and conduct a mid term review. \r\n\r\n \r\nOwnership facilities:\r\nThe traditional kinship organization of the barangay had maintained the communal use of land. The legal owner of the facilities will be the barangay represented by the barangay captain. The barangay captain has to give authorize the use of land for constructing a water reservoir and to stand in for the maintenance of the water reservoir. If there are problems with WOPD and the barangay captain, the city Guindulman, in person of the counsellor, head of barangay captains, will be the mediator, and in case of emergency he can force the barangay captain to cooperate. In 2007 WOPD will consult  a public notary special for asking the legal rules about ownership and how to make a written agreement between WOPD, the water committee and the barangay captains. Eco sanitation is a new facility and will be spoken too for now as a public service  and for in the future in the households.\r\n\r\nProject implementation:\r\n4 water systems, including tanks and  3 pilot ecosan toilets will be constructed. Water resource management training will be given to 12 local women\u2019s organisations.\r\n\r\nOperator facilities:\r\nThe operator will be the water committee in the community. All the barangays have a water committee, selected by the residents with men and women. The water committee is related to the board of the community. Most of the women of the water committee are also a member of the local women organization. If there is a water problem the water committee is going to the barangay captain. The relationship between each other is based on traditional rules. Till now there isn\u2019t a written agreement between the barangay captain and the water committee. WOPD will consult a public notary to talk about a written agreement. The staff of WOPD will support the water committees.\r\n\r\nResponsible for operation and maintenance:\r\nRegulated by law the barangay captain is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facilities  \r\n\r\nParticipation of beneficiaries:\r\nThe participants and beneficiaries are involved in the water committees. The women in the water committees are members of the local women organisation and WOPD. The staff of WOPD will support them , even when there are problems.\r\n\r\nRole applicant organisations:\r\nThe role of WOPD is: to facilitate the implementation of the project Water and sanitation for Bohol. The WOPD staff members carry full responsibility for managing the project budget according to the approved project document. They will support the water committees in the barangays and the local WOPD branches with the actual implementation. Whenever problems arise WOPD will look for solutions and take initiatives to mediate in disputes. The contribution of WOPD to the Trainings costs is Euro 500. The role of ZijActief Noord en Zuid-Holland is to give support by monitoring the project through annual visits to the project area and reporting on the status of the project. Agriterra contributes to the monitoring costs of the project as well as ZijActief during monitoring missions, which totals to Euro 8800.\r\n\r\nWfWP Seed money (Euro 1616) has been used for the preparation phase of the project.\r\n \r\nRelevant experience:\r\nWOPD and ZijActief Noord en Zuid-Holland have gained ample experience in setting up and implementing day-care centers and multipurpose centers. They have had to deal with issues like ownership of the land, obtaining building permissions, and the actual building itself. Contacts with the barangay captains have developed over time as they carry the responsibility for paying the salaries of the teachers and covering the costs for the maintenance of the day-care centres. The relationship between WOPD and the barangay captains is based on mutual respect. WOPD has more recently \u2013since two years \u2013 gained experience with business planning and micro-credit issues. There is no specific experience within WOPD with regard to WASAN but for this purpose WOPD has entered into a partnership with the GTZ Water & Sanitation Programme Bohol.\r\n\r\nOther Results:\r\n\r\nChanges for up scaling and replication\r\nWOPD has by the beginning of the project 12 local member organisations. There are a number of  possibilities for up-scaling and replication. As mentioned before the Province of Bohol has a program for information and implementation of eco-sanitation. If WOPD succeeds to promote personal and environmental hygiene and demonstrate the benefits of eco-sanitation through the WOPD pilot eco-toilets, it is realistic to expect that their number will grow rapidly in the project area. The cooperation with GTZ can also be developed and extended to other barangays. WOPD as a federation can show to authorities how important it is to support community initiatives with respect to safe water and sanitation. WOPD can use its knowledge and experience gained through this project to set-up a program for advocacy and lobby for safe drinking water.\r\n\r\n', u'WOPD knows that access to safe drinking water is necessary, especially for the development and the health of the children. In Bohol it is the women\u2019s responsibility to collect water for their own household and for the households of senior citizens in the community. WOPD concentrated on Capacity development of women by involving them as equal partners in the water & sanitation project an on promotion of gender equality and empower women by improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation. It is important to note here that all these women actively influence community life and most of the livelihood projects of the women have upgraded life in the whole community. Teachers of the day-care centres take notice of the water-supply problem especially when they learn children hygienic principle rules. If there is access to safe drinking water the women spares time and the children can get hygienic training.\r\n\r\nResponsible for the operation and maintenance is the barangays captain of the community. The operator will be the water committee of the community. Maintenance costs will be paid of the proceeds of the water bill. WOPD will facilitate the implementation of the project. WOPD staff members take full responsibility of managing the project budget according to the approved project document. They will support the water committees in the barangays.\r\n\r\nZijActief gives support by monitoring the implementation of the project by annual visits and reporting on the status of the project. GTZ is responsible for the technical part of the implementation of the project. The participants and beneficiaries are involved in the water committees. The women in the water committees are members of the local women organization and WOPD. The staff of WOPD will support them, even when there are problems. The water committees review every year the price each family has to pay for water. Senior pays less. The water committee collect the money every month. The water committee is also responsible for cleaning the environment of the water reservoir. For eco \u2013sanitation: it will be a change to show how you can use faeces as a fertilizer. That\u2019s better then pesticides. \r\n\r\nWOPD has 12 member organizations and is still growing. In 2009 there are already 17 member organizations. There are a number of possibilities for upscaling and replication. The province of Bohol has a program for information and implementation of eco-sanitation. If WOPD succeeds to promote personal and environmental hygiene and demonstrate the benefits of eco-sanitation through the pilot eco-toilets, it is realistic to expect that their number will grow rapidly in the project area. The cooperation with GTZ can also be developed and extended to other barangays. WOPD can use the knowledge and experience gained through this project to set up a program for advocacy and lobbying for safe drinking water.\r\n\r\n', u'WOPD, an umbrella for 12 local member organizations (325 women active members), is well organised in all the communities that will be part of the project \u201cWater and sanitation for Bohol. The inhabitants of the barangays will take responsibility for the implementation of the project. WOPD is responsible for the money and justify her help in the General Assemble.

Rainwater harvesting has been common practice in Thailand for as long people can remember and is  a very familiar way of collecting drinking water. However, the quality of the water is very bad by the time people start drinking it. The water contains a lot of pathogen bacteria\u2019s such as ecoli and coliform that cause diseases.\r\nThe rainwater collected at the schools is stored in large concrete tanks. The tanks are not sealed well; so small animals are able to get into the tanks. We saw maggots, mosquito larvae\u2019s, cockroaches and even lizards floating around in the tanks. Together with the dirt from the gutters and the droppings of birds and cats that flush down from the roof, it makes the so called \u201cdrinking water\u201d a very dangerous mixture.\r\nChildren drink straight from these tanks by opening a small faucet close to the bottom of the tanks. In order to have safe drinking water at the end, we should start with the beginning, the place where the water enters the tanks. It's also very important that we collect and store as much water as possible to survive the 7 month dry season. To do so we will renew all gutters and rainwater pipes that are leading to the concrete tanks. The next step is reparation of the concrete tanks, as the tanks are often cracked and leaking. The lids of the tanks are renewed with fortified concrete when necessary.\r\nThe manholes on top are completely sealed of so no animals can get in. We install a whole new underground piping system, leading to the enclosure where the filters are situated. The filters are based on an established technology that uses silver-coated balls to kill all pathogenic bacteria. The filter system is called a \u201crain purification center\u201d and was developed by a Dutch company named \u201cAquaest Europe\u201d which is specialized in rainwater harvesting systems.\r\nOnce the water has passed the filters it is clean and safe to drink. The water is collected in a clean water buffer tank which also contains a floater with silver-coated balls. An attractive drinking place is situated close to the clean water tanks where the children can tap their cup of safe water. Faucets we use are self-closing so no water will be spilled. Next to the faucets that deliver safe water, a green smiley sticker is put which makes it clear for even little children to understand that this is the right place to get their drinking water. Faucets that don\u2019t deliver clean water are marked wit a red sad face sticker to make it clear to the children that this water is not safe. A poster is placed at the wall above the drinking place which shows with drawings what the meaning of the stickers is.\r\nTest results at schools that already have the clean water system show that the water in the clean water tanks stays free of pathogenic bacteria; principals of those schools confirm fewer children get sick.\r\n\r\nOther results:\r\n -Lower number of ill children in the area.\r\n- Growing awareness of health benefits in surrounding villages by spreading the word.\r\n- Providing local unemployed villagers with construction, maintenance and \u201cextension\u201c jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", u'By placing 6 goats at the schoolyard we generate finance for maintenance. Their offspring will be sold by HOAT and this money will be used to replace the filter cartridges when necessary. Other ideas of the school\u2019s principal and teachers to generate money to replace the cartridges will be considered as they show up.\r\nHOAT stays in control of the system and the school\u2019s principal signs an agreement in which he declares to cooperate with HOAT in order to keep the system functioning.\r\nSmall maintenance of the system will be carried out by the school caretaker.\r\nHOAT will be able to perform maintenance that the school is not able to take care of. HOAT will continue to monitor the school\u2019s system which is possible by having \u201cHOAT people\u201d present in the area. 4 schools have been equipped already and more will follow, creating multiplying and effects, and also ensuring sustainibility.\r\n\r\n', u'Dutch Foundation \u201cHOAT\u201d started to install rainwater harvesting systems in Thai schools in September 2007. So far 4 schools are equipped and around 1000 children have access to safe drinking water at their schools. Children drink collected rainwater witch stands still for months in large concrete tanks and which is full of pathogenic bacteria. The system we place cleans the water and kills pathogenic bacteria. 20% of the system is imported from The Netherlands and has been tested extensively. 80 % is produced locally.  Tests in the working field in Thailand until now show the water stays clean and free of pathogenic bacteria. Teachers state that fewer children get sick since the systems are installed. We aim to provide 10 schools with the system in 2009. After this we aim at scaling up \u201cfrom projects to program\u201c.', 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-06-11', None]

Due to drought there was a delay in community mobilization, so construction work has not started yet. Of course the basic infrastructure is already present, because this project builds on the larger Kajiado environmental health program.\r\n\r\n', u'Background information Kajiado:\r\nThe Kajiado district in Kenia is mainly inhabited by the nomadic Masai population and their cattle. Safe water sources are very scarce in this arid area. In the Namanga en Mashuru divisions only 30% of the population has access to safe water (according to the latest baseline survey of July 2007). The Masai also have scarce access to sanitation facilities and there is little knowledge about the importance of hygiene and health promotion. Moreover, the area suffers from the consequences of climate change and from the overburdening of the environment, among others due to illegal wood cutting for the charcoal industry and overgrazing by cattle. Decreasing ground water levels, increasing erosion, changing micro climate and severe drought alternated by heavy rains are the consequences. \r\n\r\n\r\nBackground of AMREF\u2019s water, sanitation environmental conservation and health promotion activities in Kajiado\r\n\r\nAMREF\u2019s approach\r\nAMREF had health programmes in Kajiado, focusing on different diseases. Through AMREF\u2019s experience it appeared that there is a strong demand for more integrated and people-focused health promotion interventions rather than disease focused interventions. For that reason AMREF is implementing a new strategy, which aims to meet that demand. It is aimed that AMREF\u2019s interventions contribute to closing the gap between the formal health system and communities. Capacity building, community partnering and health system research in order to gather evidence to support advocacy, are the main pillars of this new strategy. In the light of this new strategy and based upon lessons learned in the past, the water and sanitation activities in Kajiado are complemented and integrated with components that accomplish sustainability and health promotion. \r\n\r\nKajiado Boreholes Project \r\nSince the late nineties AMREF has rehabilitated 47 boreholes in the last years with cost sharing from the beneficiary communities, with support from Waterleidingmaatschappij Drenthe (41 boreholes) and several other parties (6 boreholes) under the Kajiado Boreholes Project. This project also provided education of the local communities regarding sanitation and hygiene. For every borehole a borehole committee was formed and educated in operating and maintaining the boreholes both technically and financially. Moreover, an organisation has been established, which consists of an umbrella association that covers 7 borehole clusters. A borehole cluster typically covers 7 boreholes. Currently, a capacity building component is implemented focusing on strengthening of water and sanitation management, operation and maintenance and on hygiene and prevention of major diseases. It is estimated that 46,000 - 69,000 people will be directly or indirectly reached by these project components . \r\n\r\nKajiado WASHEC Project\r\nIn the last quarter of 2006 AMREF has started another project in cooperation with the Green Belt Movement: Water, sanitation, hygiene and environmental conservation for improved health and livelihoods in Namanga and Mashuru divisions in Kajiado district, Kenya (Kajiado WASHEC Project). Under this project 10 boreholes will be rehabilitated, 2 boreholes will be constructed and 10 shallow wells with hand pumps and 1 earthen dam will be realised. The capacity building component is comparable to the Kajiado Boreholes Project. Also Trainers of Trainers are educated in order to in health improvement and health prevention. Furthermore the project has an extensive environmental component: trees will be planted in the vicinity of the water sources in order to prevent decrease of the ground water table. The population surrounding the water sources will be sensitized and educated about environmental conservation and sustainable usage of natural resources. \r\n\r\nAdditional needs for hygiene and sanitation facilities and environmental component\r\nThe status quo at the moment of this writing (beginning of 2009) is that 53 water sources , 50 boreholes and 3 shallow well, are members of \u2018AMREF clusters\u2019. All water sources have committees for operation and maintenance and the population surrounding the 53 water sources have been sensitized and educated about the importance of hygiene, sanitation and water management and maintenance. However, in order to accomplish an integrated and sustainable health improvement in the project area there are components that should be added specifically per borehole. This proposal specifically focuses on realization of additional facilities at specific water source sites for hygienic water and sanitation practices and environmental conservation practices. In annex I an elaborate overview of components, specific per water source is given. In annex II the preliminary lay out of the envisaged borehole site and the preliminaryof the facilities\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Proposed project: realization of additional needs at Enkirrgirri/Nkaiserri borehole sites\r\n\r\nFurther to what is described above, it is herewith proposed to realize the additional needs for Eiti and Tima borehole sites. Of course the goal, objective and results are concurrent with the ongoing activities of AMREF in Kajiado. Hereunder, the objectives are outlined specifically for the project component that is herewith proposed.\r\n\r\n4.1. Goal: \r\nImproving health and quality of life of the most vulnerable people in Kajiado by increasing access to sustainable water sources and sanitation. As such the project directly contributes to Millennium Development Goal 7.\r\n\r\n4.2. Objectives:\r\n\u27a2 The number of people using safe and adequate drinking water will increase from the current 1.000 to 3.000 \r\n\u27a2 Promote the use of safe sanitation and hygienic practices, by means of demonstrating the good practice around the borehole site \r\n\u27a2 The number of children under 5 years old in the project area suffering from water borne diseases (cholera, diarrhea), will decrease with 30%\r\n\u27a2 Promote community based afforestation and soil conservation\r\n\r\n', u'A community owned management structure has been established, which consists of an umbrella association (the Kajiado Integrated Development Initiative: KIDI) that covers 9 borehole clusters. A borehole cluster typically covers 7 boreholes. Currently, this cooperative water supply company is in the process of becoming independent. Operation and maintenance is financed from the water revenues from the communities themselves under supervision of KIDI. Ownership is created by true community partnering, because the whole management structure is community owned. As such it not only ensures physical sustainability of the facilities, but it also airs the voice of the rural communities of Kajiado, enabling them to claim their right to water. Through the partnership with the Green Belt Movement the sustainability of the environment in general and the ground water table in particular is addressed: tree planting and an awareness about an integrated approach to water sourcing and recharging ground water aims to create sustainable water sources.\r\n\r\nGender is still an issue in the project. Although female representation in the borehole committees is up to standard (approximately 40%) it remains a challenge to ensure that the representation and the level of decision making are in balance. This is thoroughly addressed by means of sensitization and awareness creation. To sensitize the Masai population about gender remains a challenge though.\r\n\r\n', u'Since the late nineties AMREF has rehabilitated/constructed 50 boreholes and 3 shallow wells with cost sharing from the beneficiary communities. The local communities were also educated in the field of sanitation and hygiene. Furthermore AMREF is currently focusing on completing all rehabilitated boreholes as such that they all form proper demonstration models for environmental health promotion. For this reason additional sanitation and hygiene facilities and a thorough environmental conservation component is added. The latter is done in close partnership with the Green Belt Movement.

As a result, all 160 households are fetching water from these 3 taps where women have to wait in queue for hours to get water.

The proposed project will be of the same nature. The local authorities and villagers are ready to carry out all the building works, and pay for water when the system is finished. World Vision and the local authorities have developed a detailed feasibility study, project plan and budget for the water supply system of Urut. \r\n', u'Urut is located 7 km from the provincial town Stepanavan in the mountains, 1450 m above sea level. It has 1337 inhabitants and 312 households. The villagers identify water as their biggest problem. The only access to drinking water in Urut is a water pipe that comes from the nearby town, and only gives water every second day for 2-3 hours. Villagers have to stand in line to collect the water, which is transported in reservoirs in horse carts to their homes. Some streets are connected to the old water system build in 1972, which is out dated. The bad state of the pipes allows rain, dirt and sewage water to enter the water system and the water system poses a risk for diseases. \r\nAround 2 km from Urut, mountain springs supply fresh drinking water. Pipes need to be purchased and installed in order to bring the mountain water to Urut. The work will be carried out by the villagers and local authorities with support of WECF and World Vision experts and supervised by EcoLore.

The requests for surveys and installations can hardly be managed anymore by AIDFI, and transferring the technology to organizations in other countries is the main strategy to cope with this interest. In 2008, a full technology transfer was done to Afghanistan, which led to the establishment of a hydraulic ram company in the Takhar province in Northern Afghanistan, which now produce and install the pump locally. We aim to duplicate the same technology transfer method to Colombia.', u'The project will start with a feasibility study and site visit in Colombia by an expert from AIDFI (Philippines), to identify suitable sites to install the first pilot pumps. Two ram pumps will then be installed, serving 1200 people with access to water for drinking, sanitation and hygiene and production of crops and livestock. An important of the installation is the training of the local beneficiaries in operating, maintaining and repairing the ram systems.  The selection of two-three ram technicians in every project is vital for the sustainability of the systems.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, two technicians from Aprotec, Colombia will travel to the Philippines, and receive a 6-week hands-on training course on all aspects of the manufacture, installation, maintenance, of the pumps. \r\n\r\nThirdly, a licensing/franchising process will be started, in which all the processes and information regarding running a succesful pump manufacture organization, such as design drawings, training manuals, and community involvment programmes, are transferred to Aprotec in Colombia.\r\n\r\nFinally, during the start-up of the production of ram pumps in Colombia, follow-up monitoring, trouble shooting and impact assessment will be undertaken by AIDFI, through email.\r\n\r\nWe aim to duplicate the same successful technology transfer method to transfer the technology to Colombia. In due course, the technology will also be transferred to other countries which have shown interest, such as Nepal, Timor and many others. The Afghan experience has shown that it is very important to transfer the technology in a thorough way, in which the 6-week training course is a main component. \r\n\r\nThe Colombian NGO Aprotec has been in different appropriate technologies for many years:  hydro power, windpower, biomass, water pumps and solar.  Head Engineer Mauricio Gnecco has been there since the 1970\u2019s.  They have a well equipped shop in which they will be able to fabricate the hydraulic ram pump.  They also have good technical connections in the region.  The group is very excited in acquiring the technology and has already identified areas were the ram model of AIDFI can be piloted.\r\n\r\nEngineer Mauricio Gnecco, who has worked with appropriate technologies for a long time through Aprotec, has studied the potential of the ram pump during the past 15 years.  Aprotec has identified many places to install ram pumps.  Aprotec is convinced of the AIDFI model of the ram and is interested in getting the technology (including manufacturing) transferred. \r\n\r\nFrom 1945 \u2013 1980 hundreds of ram pumps have been fabricated and installed by the big coffee farmers in Colombia. The ram pumps were of the old over- dimensioned model of heavy cast iron and brass valves. A foundry shop in Armenia (a city in the coffee region) fabricated them but ceased operation ten years ago. Many ram pumps stopped operation or were pulled out because of the availability of cheap electricity and electric pumps.  Some of these rams have been rescued and are for sale right now. The old models available are more complicated in operation, repair and maintenance than the ones from AIDFI, and are more expensive. \r\n\r\nWith high prices of fuel, electricity and the awareness of Climate Change there is a huge potential for the re-introduction of the hydraulic ram pump.  The pumps from AIDFI are also more efficient and can deliver more water to higher elevations.', u'The project has sustainability of the pump manufacturing and installation capacity in Colombia as its main goal. Technicians from Aprotec in Colombia will receive a full six week training in all aspects of pump manufacture, installations, maintenance, sales, etc. They will also receive the full specifications and licenses for the local production of the hydraulic ram in Colombia. This is aimed at the establishment of a self-sustaining business in which hydraulic ram pumps are produced and installed in Colombia. \r\n \r\nKnowing that a perfect technology alone will not guarantee a sustainable system, AIDFI developed a community involvement program in different aspects of the projects: surveys, meetings, hauling, actual construction, set up of water committees and training of local technicians in operation, repair and maintenance.    \r\n', u'In Colombia, there is a hugehuge potential for Hydraulic Rams, because there are around 3 million displaced farmers who are coming back to their farms or new areas but who don\u2019t have water/energy infrastructure for living and for food production.

The siphon filter which is an innovative low cost filter will be the core technology to be promoted, together with other environment-friendly options like SODIS (Solar Disinfection) . As soon as children, teachers and parents get used to that, they will help promote the concept to the community through an IEC-social marketing program in cooperation with the local health care service. It is expected to change the behaviour in HWTSS (Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage) in other settings like home, field and public places.\r\n\r\nThe main activities will include:\r\n1. Introduce to local education and health administrations\r\n\r\n2. Select target communes and schools: 4 communes, 12 schools\r\n\r\n3. Organize complete water filtration and safe storage systems at school\r\n\r\n4. Train children, teachers/ school staff on system O&M and facilitate O&M team formation and rules\r\n\r\n5. Link with local SME and set up distribution and service system\r\n\r\n6. Train health workers on participatory methodologies in rural water and sanitation, coach for HWTSS IEC-social marketing program\r\n\r\n7. Train children, parents and teachers/ school staff on health, safe water and  environment-friendly HWTSS options, introduce siphon filter and safe storage\r\n\r\n8. Children, parents and health workers carry out IEC-social marketing activities for HWTSS behavior and options for local communities\r\n\r\n9. Project governance, M&E: local project coordinator and monitoring officer, monthly planning and reporting system\r\n\r\n10. Evaluate and document project process and results: project process documented, evaluation report with data from target area and control area.', u'The water filtration and safe storage system is based on a very simple non-electrified technology such as the siphon filter, which is easy and safe to run and manage for small children. The schoolchildren will be assisted to form O&M (Operation and Management) teams and set rules to keep the system in order. This process will strengthen the awareness, ownership and empowerment of the children, making them confident to disseminate the knowledge and behaviour to their parents and community. \r\n\r\nThe IEC -social marketing program initiated by the schoolchildren is expected to lead to the behavioural change of the local communities and create the demand among parents and local people for the environment-friendly solutions promoted. At least one local enterprise will be connected to start supplying the filters and so  create a sustainable supply chain. The user training, spare parts and after-sales service will be provided by the enterprise so that the consumers can use and maintain the system properly for a long time. The spare part replacement and service for the systems at school is very affordable (around 6 euros per system for 30 users per school year) and parents are expected to contribute from the second year onwards.', u"The unhealthy habit of drinking water directly from the source without any treatment is very common in the rural area of the Dien Bien province, North West of Vietnam, especially among small children. At school they do not often have access to safe drinking water, so either they drink unsafe water, or they do not drink at all. In addition, a lot of small children from ethnic minority groups live far away from home to go to school; they live on their own and prepare food and drink for themselves with whatever water they have access to. The water supply coverage in Dien Bien is poor, rural people get water on their own from open wells, lakes, streams or water pools. They hardly treat it and often drink unsafe water since they do not take the time to boil it. The two target districts are poor rural areas with 131,443 people from 26,607 households. There are 142 schools with 47,606 schoolchildren and 4,157 teachers in the area. Among various ethnic groups the biggest are Thai, Kinh and H'mong.", 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-09-07', None]

The ultimate goal is to ensure that all the knowledge around production, installation, use and maintenance of those pumps is available in-country and so offering a high quality community drinking water pump that is suitable for the extreme conditions like very low water tables as can be found in Niger.\r\nPart of the project approach is additional training of the cooperatives that are now producing and installing Volanta pumps, using the training manuals that PRACTICA has developed with ETC and the Volanta pump producer in Burkina Faso.', u'In the Dosso region in Niger, people in rural villages depend on handpumps to collect groundwater, which can be as deep as 80m. For the deepwell pumps that are being used in this area, lack of a decent spare part supply system  is the main reason for some 200 pumps currently being out of order. To improve access to water in this region, PRACTICA wants to make a start with rehabilitation of a number of pumps and improving the maintenance system and spare part supply in the region.', u'Sustainability of the project is extremely important, as it will be a start-up of improving the whole maintenance structure for Volanta deepwell pumps in the region, including improving spare part supply and improving the skills of the pump mechanics in the region.  The project will function as a pilot, starting with 15-20 water points, where the water user committees will be encouraged to initiate the actions needed to rehabilitate the water point. In most cases, this will include repairs on the pump and replacement of parts. Costs associated with this should be covered by the committee to some extent, creating additional funds to support other committees.\r\nAdditional training (both technical and business training) of local pump mechanics will ensure that knowledge around installation and repairs of deepwell pumps is not going to waste and will enable those mechanics to run a profitable business.\r\nThe first order of spare parts for 20 water points will enable the local production facility for Volanta pumps in Niger, ACREMA  (Atelier de construction et r\xe9paration du mat\xe9riel agricole; Tahoua) to pick up production and invest in production means. To guarantee the quality of the spare parts, PRACTICA will give additional training in quality control for ACREMA and C-DARMA, both working with Volanta pumps and part of the same cooperative umbrella organisation in Niger.\r\nWith maintenance systems in place, PRACTICA will put effort in convincing other organisations to use the locally produced Volanta pumps as to stimulate the local economy and local private sector. \r\n', u"The drinking water supply for people and cattle in the region Dosso, Niger, depends almost completely on water from deep boreholes.\r\nIn the early '90 around 400 locally manufactured Volanta handpumps were installed on boreholes in the villages by 10 local mechanics, who were also trained and equiped to maintain these pumps. A spare part supply structure was installed in the region. For the management of each handpump a village water committee was trained. This structure functioned well for more then a decade until the spare part supply in the region became a problem. Actually some 60% of these pumps are therefore out of order. Relatively simpel repairs could bring them again into good working order.\r\nThe local water authorities together with PRACTICA and the local pump manufacturer ACREMA search funding for redynamizing the spare part supply and to start the repair of these pumps. C-DARMA, based in Dosso, will take the lead for this rehabilitation project. ", 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-09-17', None]

And even where there is access to water, the water is often too saline for human consumption (in the Ambazoa area,  conductivity levels average around 8.000 \u03bcs/cm with 3.000 \u03bcs/cm being the upper limit for drinking water in Madagascar). However, as there are hardly any alternatives, people have no other choice than to drink this water.\r\nTechnology options to desalinate the water are costly in both investment as recurrent costs and are thus out of the scope of the rural communities. It is for this reason that PRACTICA has started working on small scale and low cost options for desalination of water.\r\n\r\n', u'Already 12 years ago PRACTICA has done some conceptual work on developing a small scale cyclic evaporation and condensation desalination system that uses air as a carrier to extract fresh water from saline water. The heat needed for evaporation of the water is generated by solar panels. The big advantage of this system is that the solar heat used for evaporation of the water is regenerated and fed back into the system. This results in a smaller solar collector surface needed to add heat to the system, making the whole system much smaller and more economic than traditional solar still systems.\r\nThe cyclic evaporation and condensation system has the big advantage that the expected water production is 5-10 times more than conventional solar still systems. This reduces the size and the costs of the system. Also the system requires less maintenance and less specialized technical knowledge than common reverse osmosis systems. \r\n\r\nThe major problem with the new desalination system is that there is no good information about the feasibility. First step within the process is to develop a theoretical model, to conduct full laboratory testing and to come with recommendations about the feasibility of the system. PRACTICA wants to employ a research student to conduct the work. This can be scheduled for the first half of 2009. The research work should include:\r\n-\tA desk study to find out the state of art of different desalination systems;\r\n-\tDeveloping a theoretical model to confirm the feasibility of the concept and to learn the physical constraints;\r\n-\tBuilding a prototype of the system on laboratory scale;\r\n-\tConducting basic tests on the system to confirm the theoretical model;\r\n-\tConducting extensive tests on the system to predict practical applicability in field situations;\r\n-\tStart field testing with the unit;\r\n-\tExpand field testing and/or implementation in the South of Madagascar if feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'Sustainability of the programme is directly related to the results of the prototype testing and field testing. If feasible, PRACTICA will put effort in publication and further distribution of the results to make sure the technology is known and available for all. Besides, PRACTICA will seek additional funding to continue implement desalination devices in Madagascar and other countries.\r\nAll the technologies PRACTICA develops are in the open domain, which means that the technologies are open to use for anybody who wants to serve the same goal as PRACTICA: to reduce poverty by improving the technical means. \r\n', u'Primarily, the potential application of this desalination system is as stand-alone unit in small and remote villages. Especially coastal communities often face problems with high salinity levels of their drinking water sources. Once further developed, it can be expected that the system can also work for larger schemes as an alternative for large and expensive reverse osmosis units.', 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-10-01', None]

The system includes sizing of the system based on usage, roof size and rainfall patterns; installation of guttering and down pipes; installation of a first flush diversion system to prevent contamination of water by diverting the first flow of water off the roof away from storage tank; animal and insect proofing on inlet and over flow, a manual bicycle pump to lift water to an overhead tank; a gravity feed distribution system; internal piping and taps to at least 2 points.', u'Cambodia rates number 136 on the human development index one of the lowest ranking in South East Asia. Water and sanitation access is particularly low with infrastructure at health centers, schools and hospitals remains problematic.\r\n\r\nWater is often sourced from surface waters and routine water boiling is not widely practiced. Ground water sources are sometimes contaminated with naturally occurring minerals exceeding national standards. In the wet season about 80% of rural households collect and use rain water for drinking and cooking and is regularly cited as the preferred drinking water source.\r\n\r\nThe provision of formalized rain water harvesting systems will complement the sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and behaviour change components of this HC WASH project.\r\n', 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-09-25', None]

This will provide an average family of 5 with 13 litres of safe water each per day for five months.\r\n\r\nAction steps are as follow: \r\n1.1 Prepare selected beneficiaries to mobilise required resources (human, financial and material): The beneficiaries have to contribute towards the development of the facilities. They mobilise the required finances (25% of material cost per tank), gutters, organise to transport construction materials from a central point and make arrangements to provide unskilled labour.\r\n1.2 Identify local artisans for construction of the tanks: It is the intention of the LVIA to build the capacity of community members as a way of ensuring that they can replicate the innovations on their own even after the completion of the project implementation period. It is for this purpose that will be identified local artisans for the construction of the tanks.\r\n1.3 Procure skilled labour and necessary materials for construction by implementing partners: LVIA will provide materials non locally available that are required for constructing the water tanks except the gutters that are provided by the community. Before commencement of construction these items will have to be procured and put in place.\r\n1.4 Construction  the ferro cement tanks: Selected artisans will built the ferro-cement tanks and the rain water harvesting facilities under the project supervision.

Some 200 ram pumps now supply some 30.000 persons with clean drinking water.  The installations promote the technology itself.  The demand is growing.  In order to be able to cope up with the demand, AIDFI has trained installation teams in other provinces.  There are communities which want to avail of a hydraulic ram pump but which don't have the funds for an installation.  With this fund we plan to implement 6 complete installations.\r\nAIDFI has perfected the technology.  It has developed a local model with unique features.  The most important part, the waste valve is moved by a door hinge, easily available in any hardware.  Another feature is the steel to steel movement of the valve.  This saves expensive gaskets.  The checkvalve can be made from materials like old car tires.  AIDFI has worked consistently on the development of the pump for years with the model having the same performance as the  commerical ones.", u'AIDFI is a very serious organization and working very hard to become more and more self reliant.  It works with low overhead budgets and knows how to maximize resources by applying durable but low cost techniques in its water systems.', u'The hydraulic ram pump projects which AID Foundation implement are owned, operated and maintained by the communities.  Before the technical intervention takes place, the community is socially prepared for the project.  First some contacts are made, then at a later stage a general assembly is called for to organize an water association.  Participation of the people is a vital part of the installation.  Often hauling and pipe laying/burying is done by local labor.   Also the association selects two or three local technicians before the start of the installation.  They are involved in all aspects and no secrets are kept.  The experience is that the local technicians after the installation are capable to operate, tune and repair the installation.  At the end of the installation the technicians revceive a t-shirt with at the back the name ram pump technician.  The association receives a complete toolkit needed for repair and maintance.  At the same time the association is prepared for the management of the project, policies are established.  A collection system and fees are also established.  The fees are partially to pay for the local technicians, for eventual repair and maintenance and sometimes for the association to expand the services.  AIDFI also organizes a meeting regarding the importance of protecting the water source itself, what is a pump without water.  As a result of such meetings tree planting are organized.  Initially 500 trees are planted but when the community is excited, more trees are facilitated.\r\nAlready twice AID Foundation organized a conference for the local technicians of all installed systems to exchange experiences.  Not in a expensive place, but just the workshop of AIDFI serves as the venue for inspiration.  In this way we exchanged indigenous solutions for maintence challenges.  For example plywood as a cheap alternative for gaskets.', u"On the island of Negros Occidental most of the land is occupied by sugarcane plantations.  The plantations are in the hands of a few rich landowners and with thousands of poor and exploited sugarworkers.  With the high prices of sugar on the worldmarket, the plantations expanded up to the mountainous areas.  The even higher areas were then taken by small farmers.  These people are isolated from all basic services like water and electricity.  Often these farmers or villagers have to go down steep hills to fetch water, a dangerous job especialy during rainy season.  The only contact which these far flung communities have with government people is during campaigns for elections.  Many then promise the people water.  However they failed to serve.  Most villagers lost hope for any of the services of the government.  In the case of water they also think that it is impossible to get the water up to areas of 200 meters.

Since there is a real interest towards the rope pump from visitors to our techno park, we had to produce and install a few rope pumps.  Within the technical department there is also a R&D section and for quite some time the idea has floated to come up with other forms to drive the rope pump.

However the quality of projects implemented are gravely affected by the corruption within the government. Contractors and sub contractors are out for easy profits which hinders quality work.  In many cases local politicians concentrate on cheap Chinese handpumps in order to collect votes during election campaigns.  These pumps, which are meant for private used, are installed in communal settings and therefore show many technical defects.  There are still many areas where unsafe water supplies are serving the people and in many instances the water is far from the homes or farms.  Since the Philippines has stil an abundance of water (because of its long raining season) it is rather a technical and political problem than a problem of water scarcity.

Most of the youths (between 15 and 25) are unemployed and lack skills to generate their own sustainable livelihoods. One of the main factors is the low level of education and skills training. Many of the young people do not finish their school, because they were not able to afford the school fees and associated costs. The school drop outs are unskilled and unproductive, which in turn has affected negatively the self-esteem and has led to increased levels of loitering, alcohol abuse and criminal activity. Moreover, many of the girls turn to prostitution for their living. \r\n\r\nCYP is a community based non-governmental organisation established in 2001 and registered with Registrar of Societies and the Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority (TEVETA) in Zambia.', 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-10-15', None]

WHO, 2004\r\n', u'Rainwaterharvesting offers a sustainable and renewable watersupply option. In the rainy season from June to October there is abundant water streaming from the houseroofs in the tank. (Rainfall of avarage 2000 mm yearly during last 20 years) Rainwaterharvesting with roofwater systems has negligable negative impacts on the environment  or ecosystem function. A ferrocement tank consists of cement and steel, wich guarantees a long  lifetime, usually 10 to 15 years and more. In the Middle East, there are still cisterns (watertanks) in use dating from the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nOur technology of collecting water from roofs in ferrocement tanks is developed and adapted in the local context of the Balanta village. Because a tank is owned by one family, the oldest woman of the family feels responsable for control, cleaning and maintenance. A family contributes  \u20ac15,00 in money and material for her tank, to increase the sense of ownership. \u20ac15,00 is a relatively large amount in Guinee-Bissau. Normally there are no maintenance costs, just cleaning costs. When a tank leaks, it is possible to repair it in a simple way using cement. In every village there are masons who can do the repair if necessary.\r\nThe materials, cement and steelwire can be bought in Catio, the capital of the region. \r\n\r\nThe projectmanager and the trainers were born and live in Catio or neighbouring villages. Everyone knows them and can find them for help. They have their own tank at home and instruct neighbours how to use it.  No chemical product or plastics are used in the tank. All the tools are context appropriate and locally available in Catio.', u"Guinee-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world. The villages in the project are located in a delta near the sea. Most inhabitants are of the Balanta tribe, they are self- sufficient ricefarmers.  In the dry season the wells dry up during March, April, May and June. The deeper groundwater is salt, therefore deep wells give non potable water. The 50 tanks are planned to be build in the village Cobumba. It means that women and often girls have to walk several km a day to obtain drinking water from inland wells. Girls cannot go to school because of these tasks. When there is no time to fetch clean water, families don't have another choice but to drink the polluted water. As a result diarrhea and cholera often occurs, wich translates into a mortality rate of children up to 5 years of 20%. Latrines are still rare in Tombali, therefore these are part of the overall program.  ", 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-10-16', None]

It is also among one of the most densely populated country of the world, and at the same time one of the poorest countries. The access to safe water and the use of hygienic latrines in the rural area of Bangladesh is limited mainly because of the remoteness of the area, and poverty. Bangladesh suffers from two additional problems with their water facilities: arsenic poisoning and salination (near the coast). In the past many water wells were dug to a depth of 15 meters. Because of this many inhabitants of Bangladesh suffer from arsenic poisoning. Inhabitants drink salinated water which is unhealthy in the long run.

To make sure the project will be sustainable the following aspects are included:\r\n\r\nIn order to involve the local community in the project 200 signatures and \u20ac100 need to be collected before a deep tube well will be dug. It is also obligatory to attend an educational meeting and a maintenance committee is established that is responsible for the functioning of the water well. Before installation of the deep tube well and/or latrine local people have to attend a meeting on hygiene.\r\n\r\nLatrines are not provided free of costs (ownership is key in this process). The project foresees in the establishment of a Village Sanitation Center where village people can buy a latrine. ', u'Bangladesh is often considered as the largest delta of the world. It is also among one of the most densely populated country of the world, and at the same time one of the poorest countries. The access to safe water and the use of hygienic latrines in the rural area of Bangladesh is limited mainly because of the remoteness of the area, and poverty. Bangladesh suffers from two additional problems with their water facilities: arsenic poisoning and salination (near the coast). In the past many water wells were dug to a depth of 15 meters. Because of this many inhabitants of Bangladesh suffer from arsenic poisoning. Inhabitants drink salinated water which is unhealthy in the long run. \r\n\r\nAs part of these projects Deep Tube Wells are installed (to a depth of 300 meters), which provide the local people with safe (arsenic free) drinking water.

This is especially true in small isolated communities that will never benefit from the large donor funded drilling projects because they are often not included in national plans and do not have the financial capacity and infrastructure to be reached for safe water supply. \r\n\r\nExisting manual drilling teams are used to create the 20 sustainable water points as an affordable solution in the access to groundwater to a maximum depth of 30 meters. The technique uses cow dung, an excellent substance for low cost drilling fluids, but negative assumptions make organisations hesistant to rapidly accept the technique. The field experiences show otherwise and encourage low cost drilling fluids. The alternatives, such as biodegradable polymers are incredibly expensive and will add 15 - 20 % to the prise of a borehole, while cowdung is free and widely available \r\n\r\nA solid investigation and proving facts could help to increase the progress and acceptance in many other upcoming water supply programs. Chad serves as an example project, where the Government was/is reluctant to accept low cost technologies such as manual drilling, but monitoring, testing, quality mechanisms and example projects helped to convince Government, which now accepted manual drilling as a national standard.

Currently application of ash over the feaces and the leveling of cone shaped heaps of feaces are done manually. Initially individuals were collecting the urine from the household toilets in claypots and using for kitchen gardens. Now plastic containers have replaced the pots. In households with small homesteads and with no kitchen garden the excess of collected urine is let out to other plants and trees. A few families still have clay pots. IEC/ Awareness programs are being conducted  under WASTE ISSUE 2.\r\n', u"Fetching water and keeping the house and surroundings clean are mostly done by women and girls.  In the current situation sprinkling of ash over the feaces in the chamber is done by the users.  However, leveling the cone shaped heap of feaces is normally done by women manually.  The mechanisation will reduce their burden as well as make it hygenic and scientific. Both kitchen garden and sale of urine will generate income.  \r\nHereby the needs of the families especially of children could be fulfilled to some extent.  It is to be noted that many families have started to raise kitchen gardens after the construction of the Ecosan toilets. The urine is used for kitchen gardens only.  Sometimes not all the collected urine could be used in household with small homesteads (poorest families). Regular collection for sale to the farmers will solve the problem. It is to be mentioned that formerly everybody used to defecate in the open fields and roadsides. In Musiri the bank of river Kaveri was the favourite spot. Womenfolk had to do this before sunrise and after sunset. Because of this they had experiences from insects to snake bites.  When it rains everyone found it difficult to go out to answer nature's calls. For the sick and handicapped persons it was worse. Later sanitary  (pit as well as septic tank) latrines came into use. It had its own disadvantages like (a)  the demand for water increased and (b) money had to be spent for removing the black water. The latest development of  ECOSAN toilet has no such problems. However  mechanization and arrangement to collect and pay for the urine will make things easier,  profitable and the ECOSAN popular. It will have positive impact on women, girls, the sick and the handicapped.", u'The target families will be aware of ECOSAN concept, advantages and proper usage and maintenance through the awarness and training programmes including field visits. The bad experiences or the negative impact of open defecation and of the use of conventional latrines had made them think of  alternatives. Already a number of families had found it in the ECOSAN toilets.They are sure to share their experiences of ECOSAN with others which will be a motivating factor for ECOSAN propagation. Construction of ECOSAN toilets and the related education programme in the schools are sure to motivate the younger generation towards ECOSAN. They will be the advocates and ambassadors of ECOSAN resulting in child to child,child to parents, child  to the community communication. Thus a favourable climate wil be generated for ECOSAN. SCOPE has already constructed ECOSAN toilets as mentioned earlier and efforts are going on to mobilize financial support from different quarters including government. So more families will be constructing  these toilets. Arrangements for regular collection and sales of the urine and the mechanization will be  major motivational factors. The ECOSAN toilets have undergone modifications based on the feedback  from the users and maintenance staff of the community toilets. It is estimated that because of this the toilets are expected to be in use for not less than 20 years. Due to uncertain rains and the political conflicts between Tamilnadu and Karnataka States the  ground water shortage and reduction in the quantum of river water are threatening the livelihood and health and hygiene of the people in Musiri (as in other similar places). Letting out  the black water into the river is polluting the holy river Cauvery.The current pollution if continued, will not only make the water sources unsafe and unusable but also endanger the lives of the people.  Since ECOSAN toilets require less amount of water than conventional toilets, sustainability is assured. The solid and liquid wastes from the Ecosan toilets will be very valuable as manure and so will generate demand. This will be an attraction to use and maintain the Ecosan toilets. The escalating costs of the chemical fertilizers  will increase the demand. The farmers will also support ECOSAN since urine as manure will reduce the cost of the chemical fertilizers. The training will provide necessary input on the advantages of urine as manure. Thus all the above factors are sure to contribute for sustainability and the upgradations envisaged are sure to be the major factors behind it.', u"Musiri is on the high water table  bank of the river Cauvery. Outwardly it will appear that water is available in plenty. But  because of the political conflicts between Tamilnadu and Karnataka States, receipt of water in the river has considerably reduced over the years. Monsoon is very uncertain so with less water the agricultural area will suffer a lot.  Construction of Ecosan toilets are slowly on the increase.  Musiri is a Taluk head quarters where thousands of people visit everyday.  It has a busy farmers' market, hospitals, bus stand and temples and 12 schools and a college with hostels.  Therefore lobbying and advocacy are going on for constructing ECOSAN toilets to cover the respective populations.  Consequently, more urine has to be collected and disposed.  This project will be the beginning.\r\n", 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2009-11-20', None]

After verifying the need, Agua para el Pueblo (APP) engaged in discussions with the community water board and other local authorities. Presentations were given to explain the AguaClara water treatment technology and an agreement was signed with key stakeholders. \r\n\r\nOn September 30, 2009, APP held a ground breaking ceremony to mark the start of the plant's construction. Currently, APP\u2019s staff and community members are building the walls of the sedimentation and flocculation tanks as well as the distribution channels. \r\n\r\nAPP has already held the first training session for plant operators and the community water board. This session is the first in a series of 10 sessions. APP is also meeting with the community water board and helping to organize a town meeting about the water treatment plant.\r\n", u'Agua Para el Pueblo (APP), one of The Resource Foundation\u2019s affiliates in Honduras, is a nonprofit organization that works to improve potable water and basic treatment systems in poor, rural communities. APP\u2019s methodology is highly participatory in both the planning and implementation phases.  It includes considerable dialogue, investigation, feasibility studies, work plans and written commitments by all parties.  Community members actively participate in the construction of aqueducts, wells, water and sewage systems, and in reforestation projects.  APP\u2019s approach promotes long-term development and self-reliance through leadership training that encourages people to take charge of their own destinies.  APP has recently partnered with AguaClara to build water treatment plants in rural communities. \r\n\r\nAguaClara\u2019s technology uses flocculation and sedimentation technology to treat surface water in a simple, affordable way. Water treatments plants are entirely gravity powered and are built on site using local labor and materials. To date, there are five AguaClara water treatment plants in Honduras which provide safe drinking water to over 15,000 people.  AguaClara is a project of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University that is improving drinking water quality through innovative research, knowledge transfer, open source engineering and the design of sustainable water treatment systems. \r\n\r\nThe project is implemented as follows:\r\n1. Signed Agreement: An agreement between APP, local authorities (municipal government/ water board) and community members was signed to outline roles and responsibilities. The agreement requires that local authorities and the community raise the monthly water tariff to $3.00 per month to ensure that the water systems are sustainable. \r\n\r\n2. Sharing of Costs and Responsibilities: APP and AguaClara completed a feasibility study and developed the hydraulic and structural designs. AguaClara also supervises two environmental engineers from Cornell University who provide technical support. The community of Agualteca is contributing unskilled labor and local materials such as sand, gravel, stone, wood, and brick. \r\n\r\n3. Pre-construction phase. During this phase, the project emphasizes community participation, with the purpose of assuring: a) The socialization and understanding of the goals, b) Negotiation for the approval of increasing the water tariff to cover operational and maintenance costs, c) Establish commitments of support, d) Determine the current state of the water system, and e) Finalize the design of the treatment plant.\r\n\r\n4. Construction: Key activities include: a) Organizing work teams and distributing responsibilities among the users, b) Constructing the treatment plant, c) Training plant operators, and d) Training users with regards to water quality and water borne illness. An APP engineer is supervising the entire construction process. In addition, two engineers from the Cornell University are providing technical support and ensuring that the plant is built according to the AguaClara hydraulic design. During the first month that the plant is operational, APP covers the expenses for the aluminum sulfate, which is necessary for the plant to function. This allows transition time for the water board to promote the raise in the water tariff and for community members to see improvements themselves.\r\n\r\n5. Capacity Building: Due to the complexity of the management of a water treatment plant, training is critical. To this end, an APP technician provides six months training to the following groups: 1) Members of the water board and other community leaders, 2) Three plant operators attend formal classes as well as one-site training. Operators learn how to keep records about plant operations and the water quality. A member of the water board is responsible for recording this information in a spreadsheet and for comparing water quality records with reports from the health ministry on water-borne illnesses, specifically diarrhea. In addition, these records serve to assure the community that the water they are drinking is safe. and 3) Community members and users of the water systems learn about water conservation and about the rationale for the increased water tariff. \r\n\r\n6. Post-construction phase. During this phase, monitoring is essential. Key activities include: a) Ensure that the plant functions adequately, b) Promote the operation and maintenance of the plant through the trained operators employed by the water authority and under applicable norms and regulations, c) Determining the level of satisfaction of the users, d) Planning for the operational sustainability of the plant, e) Continuing environmental education of the community to further ensure community ownership and sustainability of the system During this process, is necessary to audit and evaluate the water board in the aspects of administration, operation, maintenance as well as to evaluate whether the operators are complying with their responsibilities. It is also critical to assess the educational and health impacts on the community.\r\n', u'APP is committed to ensuring economic and institutional sustainability. Technical training, capacity building, and community participation are essential to its model.  To this end, APP provides comprehensive training to community water boards and plant operators to ensure that they can operate the water treatment plant efficiently, monitor and document performance of the system and the water quality, and provide maintenance as necessary. \r\n\r\nInstitutional Sustainability: The planning and preparation for the construction phase of the project involved a number of parties including  the municipal government, the health center, the educational system, the community council and other for community development organizations. APP provides training for these stakeholders on the following  topics: 1) water and local development, 2) Water contamination and its effects on health, 3) The water supply system, 4) AguaClara technology, 4) Management and operation of the treatment plant, 5) Rise in the tariff, 6)  Accounting records of the water board, 7) The law regarding water and sanitation and the rules governing the water board and 8) Appropriate use of water-quality monitoring.\r\n\r\nEconomic Sustainability: The operation of a treatment plant incurs additional expenses that must be paid by the users. The most significant expenses are the salaries of a day operator and a night operator, the purchase of aluminum sulfate and chlorine (chemicals that the plant requires to function).

Personal Hygiene and Sanitation Education (PHASE), is a successful school health model that has been developed during the late nineties and has been widely implemented in mainly rural settings. AMREF and its partners decided to adjust the PHASE model to the slum context and to start a pilot PHASE project in Kibera. \r\n\r\nUp till now the AMREF Kibera PHASE project has supported 40 schools, reaching around 8.500 pupils and their families. Monitoring of the project already showed a significant improvement in health status and school attendance. Furthermore it has been learnt that the scope of health promotion should be broader than sanitation and hygiene alone and should put young women more central.

Here, one school is singled out to serve as an example.\r\n\r\nPersonal Hygiene and Sanitation Education (PHASE), is a successful school health model that has been developed during the late nineties and has been widely implemented in mainly rural settings. Based on the successes of this project in terms of reduction of water borne diseases and school absenteeism, the Government of Kenya has incorporated PHASE into its policy framework. Since most primary schools in Kibera are non-formal and run by community-based groups and other non-governmental institutions. Therefore, the curriculum at these schools deviates from the national curriculum. Moreover, the slum context of Kibera is very different from the rural context in which PHASE was initially implemented. \r\n\r\nThe communities are encouraged to invest in water storage tanks, latrines  and hand washing facilities. This is accomplished by facilitating the realization of these facilities rather than donating them, meaning that AMREF co-finances and mobilizes the community to contribute. In order to measure impact, there are 10 control schools where the intervention is not yet implemented, under the agreement that the control schools would also be included in AMREF\u2019s envisaged upscaling if PHASE proves to be successful in the context of Kibera. ', u'The Kibera School Integrated Health Project builds and strengthens community capacity in the slum, based on AMREF\u2019s broad experience of working with vulnerable communities. The involvement of government officials, local community groups, children, teachers, parents, their associations and their wider community will help to create ownership of the project activities, which is crucial for sustaining momentum. Intensive lobby and advocacy will encourage the government to take responsibility for health and education in Kibera. ', u'Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, with a population of over one million people. Due to its informal nature, it does not receive public essential services like healthcare, sanitation or water, nor education; which is most strikingly illustrated by the flying toilet phenomenon: polythene or paper bags in which human excreta are disposed of by throwing them on roofs or in the cramped allies. \r\n\r\nThe people of Kibera, particularly women and children, are weakened by water-borne infections hence susceptible to other diseases. Health statistics fromt AMREF\u2019s Kibera Community Based Health Centre indicate that the leading morbidity cases are acute Respiratory Infections (31%) and water and hygiene related diseases like diarrheal diseases and water and hygiene related diseases (diarrheal diseases and eye infections (21%)).

The schools and other institutions that have received the trainings have also been equipped  with demonstration latrines (VIP and Ecosan) and with rainwater tanks. \r\n\r\nAlready 13 boreholes have been realised and many latrines have been built both at households and at schools. The necessary surveys in preparation of construction of the next 13 boreholes have been done and construction is starting around half 2010. \r\n', u'The national water strategy of 2002 of the government of Tanzania recognizes that the availability of water is a fundamental need and everybody\u2019s right. In Tanzania around 70% of diseases are caused by a lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene. The Mtwara District is one of the most vulnerable districts of the country. AMREF will build affordable water sources and sanitation facilities that are also easy to operate and maintain. The project focuses primarily on children and women. \r\n\r\nThis project contributes to Millennium Development Goal 7, ensuring a sustainable living environment with clean drinking water for everybody. \r\nIndirectly the project has impact on Millennium Development Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 en 6.\r\n\r\nSome of the activities for the promotion of improved access to safe water are: the construction of a borehole and 48 demonstration rain water jars on public places. Improved access to sanitation will be targeted through provision of technical support for the construction of 3.000 household latrines, construction of 48 demonstration latrines on public places (both VIP (Ventilated Improved Pit) latrines and ECOSAN (ecological sanitation) latrines). Hygiene will be promoted through hygiene and education training of 400 volunteers from the communities and 40 Trainers of Trainers (TOTs) in sanitation and hygiene according to the successful PHAST (Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation) approach. In 29 schools children will be taught about the significance of health, hygiene and sanitation according to the PHASE-method (Personal Hygiene and Sanitation Education). A multi sectoral project steering committee will be formed consisting of representatives of local governments. 40 Village Councils (VC), Water Committees (WC) en Health Committees (HC) will be established as well as \u201cChild-to-Child and Child-to-Parent\u201d health clubs. \r\n', u'The introduction of cost recovery arrangements at all communally owned water points will provide the necessary funding for the continued maintenance of water points by the stakeholders. It is envisaged that revenue collection will be raised either on every bucket of water or at household level contribution. Water user groups (WUG) will (in agreement with village leadership) establish the mechanisms and rates of payment for cost sharing including exemption criteria for household and individuals incapable of paying for water. Collections from each water point will be recorded separately. The funds collected will go towards maintaining the water points and paying incentives to the pump operators. \r\n\r\nA micro-finance approach; communities in each village will organize themselves and borrow money from their respective banks to construct new water sources (wells, boreholes). \r\n \r\nThe government commitment to continue financial support to the community through its budgetary processes and local resource mobilization structures are expected to give financial and economic sustainability to the project. Decentralization under the ongoing local government reforms provides an opportunity for improved budgetary allocation for development initiatives in the district. \r\n\r\nThe community structures established during the project period will continue to receive technical and financial (where necessary) assistance from the local authorities at the ward and district levels thereby enabling them to continue to oversee the maintenance of especially the water systems. Community involvement in project design, implementation and management as well as emphasis on applying technology that is appropriate to the level of development of the target population are all considerations for the sustainability of project achievements. \r\n\r\nBehaviour change and capacity building:\r\nSince the project intends to change the target group\u2019s way of life, the following measures have been planned to ensure long-term acceptance of its results: awareness raising training/capacity building to the community as a whole and ensuring gender balance and especially ensuring women involvement will facilitate sustainability since women are traditionally involved with the provision of water. By working with the district authority, AMREF also takes advantage to transfer skills that remain in the district. Finally, the project emphasizes on the use of locally available resources at all levels. \r\n\r\nGood environmental practice:\r\nAMREF has begun to integrate into its activities in house environmental protection policies (Environmental Impact Assessments and Audits) that must be observed in every project area. At the local level, the project will support the communities to use water from developed sources for planting new trees in an effort to conserve the environment. \r\n', u'The Mtwara District is one of the most vulnerable districts of the country. Mtwara rural district is one of 5 districts in the Mtwara Region of Tanzania, consisting of 18 wards and 118 villages with a population of 213,554. \r\n\r\nRural populations in the district are extremely under served by, and lack access to sufficient, reliable, safe and sustainable water and sanitation services. Water is a limiting factor for economic development, and for those whose livelihoods are primarily agriculture based (75%), scarce and unreliable water resources make them particularly vulnerable to poverty. Women and children of Mtwara rural district have to travel on average six kilometres to a water source in the dry season to collect water for human consumption. Poverty can in a large part be attributed to lack of access to safe water and sanitation facilities, and improper hygiene and sanitation practices, which contribute to higher incidence of water borne diseases and hygiene related health problems. \r\n', 0L, u'We need to be clear on the fact that this project is part of a big project.

As this would be a model and demonstration intervention, we will have to cover the construction cost of the ECOSAN toilets through donor agency's assistance. \r\n\r\nSanitation is important with perspective to the health standards and the privacy issues of women. Women have to wait till dusk or dawn to defecate as it becomes embarrasing during the day light to relieve themselves in the open fields. This also creates problems like constipation and higher instances of snake bites in women as they search interior places to hide themselves during defecation.\r\n\r\nSanitation is a solution but in the conventional toilets, water becomes a limiting factor in usage of the toilet. Orissa has quite a many example of defunct sanitation systems. Hence, in a state where less than 2% of the rural areas have household piped water supply, it is apt to demonstrate ECOSAN villages. \r\n\r\nThis year long intervention will focus on motivation and mobilisation of the communities towards ECOSAN toilets. There are cultural barriers as the households will have to physically clean the chamber once it becomes compost. Though it is safe, the communities get offended at the very idea. Their participation will be marked in terms of the sweat equity provided by the respective households. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the cost of the ECOSAN model of toilet is 4 times the cost of the Government promoted toilets and thus it becomes a limiting factor with the rural communities.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this project will test the social and cultural acceptability of this model for the scale up to 1000 households in the coastal Orissa belt. The operational costs will be met through a community corpous fund to be maintained by the Village Water and Sanitation Committee.\r\n\r\nThe toilets constructed under the project will be household assets and maintenance will be household responsibility. However, Village Water and Sanitation committee will take active role in the promotion of hygiene habits and meeting any exigency or extension of the project to new households with the VWSC corpus fund.", u'ECOSAN toilets can be build from the hollow bricks with better quality than the kiln brick hence the structure will have longevity. This will ensure that people are happy with their household asset and ensure to take care of the careful cleaning.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC) that is constituted will address the community unity and governance issues. The VWSC will have 15 members of which 4 needs to be women, representatives from backward communities and village level representatives of local self governance bodies.\r\n\r\nThirdly, BISWA in collaboration with the donor agency will establish 2 model villages with 100% coverage of ECOSAN toilets hence the families will not have any antagony or disagreement between them. The initial phase is devoted towards creation of community bonding for undertaking sanitation programme.    \r\n', u'Orissa is one of the poorest states in India. The state has the lowest social and human development indicators where 47% of the population lives Below Poverty Line (BPL). Majority of the households are dependent on agriculture and farm labour for source of livelihood. \r\n\r\nAs per the Census 2001, the percentage of rural households not having access to safe sanitation was 92.3%. That is of the total 67, 82,879 (Census 2001) rural households, sanitation facility was not available in 62, 59,607 households. Unsanitary practices, primarily open defecation, bad hygiene practices and the use of contaminated water remain the major causes of child death, disease and malnutrition in India, especially affecting the poor. \r\n\r\nIn the proposed 2 villages for this project intervention, there is no sanitation coverage.

Achievements include: environmental education and advocacy, Cultural & technical exchanges between Kenya and Australia, youth mobilization & network for environment conservation for river cleans, and two Safewater projects delivered. Future plans include: 1. Improving knowledge and skills on factors leading to improved environmental conservation, waste management and care of waterways. 2 Delivering at least one SafeWater project each year and establish a network of SafeWater user committees. 3. To expand the in-school project to a minimum of 6 schools. 4.To increase the capacity of TKMP to link and negotiate with government, civil society and business to achieve improved environmental policy. 5. To undertake cleanups, recycling and other solid waste management demonstration projects. 6. Continue cultural exchanges of at least one person each way each year.\r\n', u'TKMP will maintain its simultaneous focus on four program streams:\r\n\r\nRural SafeWater \r\nSafeWater is the direct result of TSC staff making a regular contribution from their wage into a fund for \u2018on-ground\u2019 infrastructure projects in Kenya. The first two Safewater projects have witnessed volunteers TSC staff members take Skyjuice water filtration equipment to Kenya and commission it in two dams in Obambo-Kadenge, namely Yawo Gona (2007) and Yawo Tinga Komieno (2008). These villages have a combined population of 6000, all of whom used to rely on heavily contaminated dam as a primary water source. A key lesson for the projects is that \u2018safe water\u2019 is away of life, and for an installation to be effective and sustainable, it must be linked to the broad factors that affect a community\u2019s ability to access clean water and sanitation, starting at the household, and addressing community and district level issues. Safewater must also work with and attract the support of other key stakeholders such as government, business and NGOs in the sector. \r\n\r\nSafeWater will continue to use the capacity of the program desk in Nairobi to identify priority projects and undertake essential community consultation and pre commissioning works.  SafeWater also now has the advantage of a technical officer based in the locality to help local water user committees maintain the infrastructure.  A mentoring project volunteer will travel to Kenya each year to oversee the implementation of additional SafeWater projects, gaining invaluable personal and vocational experience as a result. The third SafeWater project will be delivered in 2010.  \r\n\r\nEducation and Advocacy\r\nA primary task in increasing the target communities access to reliable and safe drinking water and other sanitation services is empowering the community to negotiate with the government to provide services, and wherever possible, become self sufficient in service provision. The mentoring desk works at a grass roots level to provide training in environmental hygiene, water and sanitation, and is an advocate for the needs of poor families, in both the urban and rural localities in which we are active..\r\n\r\nYouth organization and network capacity development\r\nYouth constitute almost 70% of the total Kenya population. In spite of their numbers the youth continue to face exclusion and marginalization in service delivery, lack employment, and are faced with HIV/Aids risk and the brunt of state violence. Youth lack leadership and organization that they can use to voice concerns and make far reaching change. \r\n\r\nThe mentoring desk is linking sports and the arts throughout Nairobi, in particular the upper Nairobi River Catchment, and spreading the message of urgent action to restore the rivers and environment.  Identifying and mentoring youth leaders and developing youth network organizations is a key aspect of this work. The program has been most successful through its facilitation of the annual \u2018Great Nairobi River Youth Soccer Tournament\u2019, in-school tree planting activities and monthly lecture series that provides key information to the youth. As a result a network of 100 youth clubs called \u201cYCLEAN\u201d has been formed. \r\n\r\n\r\nCultural and technical information exchange and training \r\nTweed is a highly skilled and well resourced community, from technical aspects of urban water infrastructure provision, to the organisation of sporting competitions and implementation of community based conservation projects. There is a strong desire and track record within the program to encourage regular visits of individuals working within the Kenyan arm of the project to Tweed. Experience shows that mentoring relationships form unprompted where ever and whenever our Kenyan partners meet local activists, and it is these multiple contacts that create the programs depth of commitment. Likewise, visits from Australian project volunteers to Kenya are an invaluable source of information, and inspiration, for those involved but who have never experienced the highs and lows of life in Africa.  A key aspect of this cultural and technical exchange has been the ability of Kenya program participants to attend the International Riversymposium in Brisbane, as delegates sponsored by the International River Foundation.\r\n', u'The TKMP has been in operation since 2004, with programs ensuring community education and training initiatives giving community ownership of the SafeWater project outcomes. A sustainable income to support wages of local staff, who will oversee the maintenance and monitoring of the project long term has been guaranteed from the income generated from water supply.', u'TKMP is working in marginalised urban and rural communities in Kenya.  The majority of urban poor in Nairobi live in high-density informal settlements that lack adequate water and sanitation, health and education services. The risk for exposure to water-borne disease such as cholera, and spread of HIV/AIDS related diseases is high. The rural villages in Siaya, particularly the Karemo and Boro divisions, are water stressed as the few rivers in the area have low flows due to deforestation, farming and settlement activities. Where wells and boreholes have been sunk, the water is often saline, and without assistance, communities rely on contaminated surface dams for all potable, household and stock water consumption. The present situation in both locations is an unacceptably high rate of mortality and disease due to unsafe water, limited sanitation facilities, and little awareness of hygiene practices.', 0L, u'', u'EUR', '2010-02-17', None]

Hierdoor is het mogelijk om \xe9\xe9n put van circa 9 meter te graven voor de afvoer van 4 toiletten. Op de meeste scholen is geen aansluiting op de waterleiding en daardoor gebruikt men twee grote containers voor drinkwater en water voor het schoonmaken en handen wassen. Deze containers worden door ge gemeente gevuld en met kleine kannetjes gebruikt tijdens het toilet bezoek en voor het wassen van de handen na afloop.\r\n\r\nEen belangrijk onderwerp is de opleiding van de leerlingen en docenten in het gebruik van toiletten en de noodzaak van het wassen van de handen, maar ook voor een hygi\xebnische omgeving. Dus daardoor ook het dagelijks schoonmaken van de toiletten. De ouders worden ook betrokken bij het bouwproces, omdat zij een bijdrage moeten leveren door te betalen voor het  dagelijkse schoonmaken.\r\n\r\nHet toiletten bouwproject is in 2005 begonnen met het bouwen in meisjes scholen. Na de afronding van het project van 2008 hadden 27.822 kinderen toegang tot een toilet gekregen. Hiervan zijn 16.200 meisjes, 8.164jongens en nog 3.458 kinderen in gemengde scholen.

Hiervoor beschikken nu alle scholen (waar toiletten zijn gebouwd) over twee grote containers.\r\n\r\nDe school, hoofd en leraren zijn verantwoordelijk voor het juiste gebruik van het toilet. Sinds januari 2010 is gezondheidsleer toegevoegd aan het onderwijs programma op de lagere scholen. Hierin wordt aandacht besteed aan hygi\xebne en preventieve gezondheidsleer - hoe kan men veel voorkomende ziekten voorkomen?\r\nJaarlijks wordt er aandacht besteed aan de Internationale viering van de dag voor het Wassen van de Handen na toiletgebruik. \r\n\r\nDe ouders zijn verantwoordelijk voor het betalen voor het dagelijks schoonmaken van de toiletten in de scholen. \r\n\r\nIn Gedaref worden nu al 10 jaar trainingen gegeven aan vrouwen op het terrein van preventieve gezondheidszorg. In totaal zijn er nu meer dan 54.000 vrouwen met deze kennis. Tijdens het bouwproces van de toiletten wordt een van deze vrouwen betrokken bij de school. En komt 1x per week een kijkje nemen naar de omstandigheden. Belangrijk zijn de trainings lessen voor de kinderen, de algemene hygi\xebne, het wassen van de handen, de aanwezigheid van water en de staat van onderhoud van de toiletten. Indien er problemen zijn op een van deze onderwerpen helpen deze vrouwen het probleem voor 'hun' school op te lossen.", u'Van origine zijn de meeste bewoners van Gedaref oorspronkelijk nomaden geweest. Dit betekent, dat er geen enkele ervaring is van de ouders of de kinderen met het gebruiken van een toilet. Ze zijn immers gewend geweest steeds verder te trekken. Sinds men in de stad woont en naar school gaat is het mogelijk hiervoor voorzieningen te treffen. Maar het is zowel voor de ouders als kinderen een nieuwe ervaring. Dit is ook de reden dat er zoveel aandacht moet worden besteed aan de kennismaking met het gebruik hiervan.\r\nWat we merken is dat men nu ook thuis voorzieningen wil maken, men wil ook in huis privacy hebben om zichzelf te verzorgen. Aangezien er veel arme mensen zijn, wordt gezocht naar mogelijkheden om hulp te krijgen bij de financiering hiervan. Maar we kunnen wel vaststellen dat er steeds meer huizen voorzieningen hebben. Sinds begin 2010 wordt nu dagelijks  drinkwater geleverd aan de mensen die aangesloten zijn op het distributie netwerk.

From this work we have selected the appropriate technologies to solve two major social and health problems of the islands: access to safe water and sanitation environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nNext to INA (Instituto Nacional del Agua - National Water Institute) and the Municipality of Tigre define which of the 13 public schools in the islands install the selected technologies.\r\n\r\nThe installation of technologies will be done in conjunction with an environmental awareness.', u'Today the inhabitants of the islands are supplied drinking water through bottled water that comes from the continent. This water is not only highly costly for he Islanders, but is also reliable due to the transport, and the possibility that it will be sold on the mainland.  \r\n\r\nCurrently all the sewage fluids are deposited in the river, as a result of which there is extreme pollution. \r\n\r\nThe project proposes a low-cost modular technology with high impact. The river water is extracted and stored in the reservoir where a process called electrocoagulation takes place. This process takes between 4 and 6 hours depending on what state the water is in. \r\nOnce water is pumped through a filter into the reservoir where it is stored. Water maintenance is performed with a UV-C sterilizer equipment.\r\n\r\nThe sanitation system includes the installation of a sewage plant compact. The technical conditions under which the plant operates is similar to large plants operating in the continent (activated sludge, biological treatment, primary and secondary settler). The innovation lies in its small size, modularity,  and its easy operation and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThese plants will be built in public schools because we expect children and adolescents to adapt quickly and creatively to this new innovative technology, in order not to pollute the environment. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the plan also takes into account a number of issues of interest, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Particularity: particular physical characteristics of the municipality (an island more than half of its territory) represents a challenge to solve problems that have so far not been successfully addressed (eg water, sanitation).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Challenge: While island areas do not have the high population density, like the mainland at the moment. The area is undergoing population growth, and also receives some 25,000 tourists for weekends, as it is a major tourist recreation area for Buenos Aires. This intense tourism flow increases and increases the negative environmental impact of the area (waste, pollution, etc.).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Climate Change: Various studies agree that one of the three Argentine coastal areas more vulnerable to increased flooding from climate change will be the front of the Paran\xe1 Delta. This is primarily due to increased "sudestadas" (heavy rains with strong winds from the southeast), also, as the instability of the system over the sea level rises and storm surges. This situation will increase the vulnerability of the population of the area against climate variability.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Wetland: The entire delta is a microsystem of wetland that has various ecological and environmental functions, including: water regulation, serving a refuge for biodiversity, water purification and providing a range of socio-cultural values for the local population.

The consultant for this project was Bekele Moges .The Primary school is 75% completed and educating 380 children. During summer 2010 a 4th floor will be added to complete the school. The secondary school will be constructed during the same period. When complete, there will be places for 1200 children in total. Funding is needed for a rainwater collection system and bio-sand filter at the primary school and at the secondary school (100,000 litres for each building). The engineering expertise and construction work for the existing water collection system was carried out by experienced Ethiopian organisations who have a successful track-record with this kind of project.', u'Because there is an existing successful installation, the 2 new installations will be based on the existing design but scaled up to the larger capacity needed.

Similarly, the planting of vegetable gardens watered from these projects provides a valuable teaching opportunity in which the children can learn skills needed to grow their own food as they become adults. In the Tigray region where the school is located, water harvesting is encouraged but the necessary skills and education are often missing.

This results in health problems including gasto-intestinal illness and eye infections which can have severe consequences if not promptly treated. Because most of the children at the school have one or more parents with disabilities, their family incomes are very low, even by Ethiopian standards and medicines to cure these illnesses are mostly unaffordable.

Veel mensen zijn naar de hoofdstad Monrovia gevlucht. Hierdoor is het inwoneraantal explosief gestegen. Inmiddels is er betrekelijke vrede in Liberia, maar voor de bevolking is nog een lange weg te gaan. Velen wonen in krotten en kapotgeschoten huizen. Er is groot gebrek aan voorzieningen en dit heeft ingrijpende consequenties. Zo sterven in Monrovia elk jaar honderden kinderen aan cholera. Deze ziekte, die wordt voergebracht door vervuild drinkwater en slechte sanitaire voorzieningen, slaat vooral tijdens het regenseizoen hard toe. De water- en sanitaire voorzieningen in Monrovia zijn in slechte staat en er is onvoldoende kennis over het belang van hygi\xebne. De mensen zijn daardoor genoodzaakt vervuild water te drinken en hun behoeften in de open lucht te doen. De kans om zo besmet te raken met dodelijke ziektes als cholera en diarree is erg groot.

BARKA has called several village meetings to discuss what work is needed and it was the villagers who determined that the \ufb01rst need was clean water and education for the children. BARKA has created numerous partnerships in areas of healthcare, education, water/sanitation/hygiene, agriculture, and women's empowerment.  Funds for the drilling of the well have been secured through a Burkina Faso private company. Funds to lay the initial groundwork which is now complete was secured by US school children through service-learning projects such as Walks for Water and other initiatives which raised awareness about water scarcity in Burkina Faso and funds for this project. BARKA is also working with local Burkina Faso government of\ufb01cials on both the national and local levels to ensure proper protocols of implementation.  This project is also in coordination with UN agencies such as DPI NGO, UNIC, UNICEF and UN Water. ", u'BARKA takes a holistic approach toward sustainable development.  This water project will positively impact women by reducing the amount of time spent each day walking for and carrying water.  This will enable women to use their time more productively and concentrate on small businesses to generate needed income. BARKA is already working with a local well driller to drill a borehole well according to Burkina Faso\'s national standards set out by the Ministry of Water.  Accessibility to clean water also makes it possible for girls to attend school because the need to help their mothers with the chores of carrying water are no longer necessary.  Creating gender-speci\ufb01c sanitation facilities in the school has also been shown to stimulate school attendance by girls by providing greater privacy and dignity. Irrigation will enable local smallholder farmers to plant a greater diversity of crops, combat malnutrition and eradicate the "hunger season" which occurs annually before new crops are ready to be harvested.  A village garden will be established and tended by students of the local school, This will teach them new farming technologies and techniques of sustainable agriculture as well as providing food for a much-needed school lunch program.  Tantiaka has no sanitation facilities in the village.  Digging gender-speci\ufb01c pit latrines will help reduce disease and give villagers new information about waste management and hygiene. Teaching UNICEF\'s WASH (water/sanitation/ hygiene) program in the local school will further emphasize basic hygiene education for children and their families. The reforestation project will focus on Moringa trees, a multi-purpose tree known to \ufb01ght malnutrition.', u"The BARKA Foundation has an ongoing relationship with this village. This is the \ufb01rst phase of a project expected to take 3-5 years to complete. Therefore we will have the ability to monitor progress, conduct studies, make necessary adjustments, and ensure the sustainability and proper handoff of our work. The ultimate goal of this project is to create empowerment. To that end, BARKA is already working with a group of \r\nwomen to form a village association that will be recognized by the government and eligible for project funding. For the creation of the well and sanitation facilities, a local steering committee comprised of women \r\nand elders will be formed.  Part of their responsibility will be to determine the investment of villagers in all aspects of this project as well as to \ufb01gure out a feasible form of micro-payments which will be used for future repairs and maintenance. The rope pump and treadle pumps used for irrigation will be locally sourced by an engineer who lives near the village. This engineer was introduced to BARKA through Winrock International, a development agency which has contracted rope pumps and treadle pumps from this engineer successfully in the recent past. The farmers will be trained on use and maintenance of the irrigation equipment. This will develop into training on optimized land use management. Women will be given training on proper use and maintenance of the well and the rope pump. In this way, villagers will take full ownership of all aspects of the project.

The situation is particularly dif\ufb01cult for women: maternal mortality is high, women are given away as brides, 73% are subject to genital mutilation, and they are treated as second class citizens.  Clean water is a rare commodity leading to high incidence of preventable disease and death.  School attendance at the local school is low and students complain of hunger which prevents them from learning well.  The village garden project addresses this issue in particular.

In this micro basin, in 1997 about 106 families were settled in an Agrarian Reform Settlement. Their properties are about 5 ha in media; the families have about 4 persons and the average rent US$ 265/month.This initial experience served to application and improvement of methodological instruments proposed. With FUND resources was supported collective project and Individual Plan of Farm Development. The collective project chooses was rural sanitation that was a raised problem by community.

Because of the great number of families and the small amount of resources, the Micro basin Technical Chamber has to choose strategic areas for conservation to act. To define the priority micro basin in each Basin, the following criteria are used: biodiversity, water supply for human consumption, community organization, familiar farmer\u2019s concentration and actual level of involved institutions in integrated action with resident population. To order the beneficiaries attendance in micro basin is utilized the Micro basin Executive Plan, that define the priority areas of intervention lining up the socio and environmental information.

The FUND also finance familiar farmers individual \u201cdreams\u201d of sustainable rural development. To define the individual access form and the resources application in farms was developed the Socio-environmental Good Practice\u2019s Level Evaluation Instrument. The small farmers that candidates are evaluated, and when reach 50% of socioenvironmental good practices could have access and dispose of the resources to improve the landscape management. The classified above 70%can use part of the resources to acquire capital goods that contribute to improve income generation and life quality. For individual access FUND uses another instrument called Individual Plan of Farm Development that makes the socio-economical and environmental characterize, describing all activities and developed production system, soil and water management, rural sanitation and other. In the end the Individual Plan characterize and prioritize the principal problems found, orientating the adoption of better practices and providing information for integrated planning of farm in the long-term.

It also recuperate and preserve the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and its biodiversity conservation; Promoting prevention and defense against critical hydrologic events, from natural origin or inappropriate use of the natural resources.\r\n\r\nSanitation/Product development:\r\nRural sanitation is a problem raised by many communities. In many cases, the effluent causes water contamination and mainly was detected by analyses in many farms water for human consumption high levels of contamination. The rural sanitation project supported by FUND included the installation of septic biodigester and grease traps, and fitness of water capitation system in farms. The chosen model was the proposal by EMBRAPA (Brazilian Research Enterprise) that allows the final effluent use as a fertilizer of crops (less annual crops). This project contributes to decontamination of groundwater and the rivers (and therefore S\xe3o Jo\xe3o River), healthier ambient to families, increase in crop productivity (using the effluent of process), and water consumption with satisfactory indices of quality.\r\n\r\nEducation/Tranning:\r\nThe Environmental Education Program \u201cCommunities in Action in Micro basins\u201d, is part of Participative Environmental Management in Micro basins Program, that produced a participative environmental diagnosis and plans of environmental action built collectively, whose propositions pointed the recognition of the environmental conservation and recuperation necessity by community, but letting clear that this actions and measures should be elapsed from shared compromises in facing the identified challenges. This project involves the rural communities and also the schools of the watersheds, and is essential for the beginning of FUND activities. It is also observed greater community involvement, with more participation of school, other neighborhoods in the action to improve the micro basin\u2019s environment.

The implementation of this decentralized and participative model requires a close collaboration and negotiation among the different government levels \u2013 federal, state and municipal, as well as between these and water users and civil society organizations. This collaboration and negotiation is to be developed within River Basin Committees, where representatives from all the above mentioned segments are to participate.\r\nIn 2005, is created Araruama and Saquarema Lagoon and S\xe3o Jo\xe3o, Una e Ostras Rivers Basin Committee \u2013 The Lagos S\xe3o Jo\xe3o Basin Committee.

Many village committees have been formed which are trained to manage, repair and maintain the facilities. 75 Community Health Workers were recruited and trained who in return trained the beneficiaires on hygiene and sanitation. As part of the training on environmental care, 1250 fruit trees were planted in the villages and 290 stoves are in use. \r\nThere is a marked change in attitude among the people who are now enthusiastic to use latrines and other sanitation facilities as a result of training. The project works closely with government departments especially the Ministry of Water as well as the Ministry of Health in areas of water, health and sanitation. \r\n', u'Approach\r\nThe project described here is part of a big integated health program benefitting 7.500 people in 2010. Here, one community is singled out as an example.\r\n\r\nCreating sustainability is a key factor. The program is not just focusing on the short term solutions by building latrines and digging water resources but also offers activities for the long-term. These activities are the health education and awareness meetings with the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are able to take their responsibility for their health and for the success of the program. The beneficiaries receive training on basic health & hygiene, and hiv/aids prevention. Besides these trainings, special workshops are organized promoting gender equality and environmental care. \r\n\r\nGender equality\r\nThe project gives leadership training to women and engages them positively in project activities. At this moment, at least 40% of the committee members are women. Efforts are being made to increase the participation of women in decision-making frameworks. Both men and women are receiving training in human rights, equality and sharing of roles and responsibilities within development realm. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental care\r\nThe target group is trained on tree planting and reforestation. On the other hand, through promoting the use of energy saving stoves the firewood demand will be reduced.\r\n\r\nLocal committees\u2019 tasks\r\nAfter a training period, the local committees will be responsible for the (financial) management and maintenance of the facilities. They will also be involved in training the community health workers in basic health and sanitation. Another important task is regularly collecting data on the health situation of the target group, including prevalence of water borne diseases and number of hiv/aids cases. In this way, improvements can be easily measured.', u'Financial sustainability \r\nTarget: Project committees are able to maintain boreholes \r\nIndicator: Beneficiary contribution is in place and increased by end of 2010. \r\n\r\nOrganisational sustainability \r\nTarget: Ownership of the community is realised.\r\nIndicator 1: Establishment and training (TOT) of 2 community committees on health/hivaids and hygiene.\r\nIndicator 2: After having received training from the committees, the community health workers give public trainings themselves to the communities.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental sustainability \r\nTarget: Awareness on environment among target population improved. \r\nIndicator: 650 trees are planted and 60 energy saving stoves in use.\r\n\r\nTechnical sustainability \r\nTarget 1: Communities are trained in management and maintenance of the facilities. \r\nIndicator 1: 96 community members will be trained on technical maintenance by end of 2010. \r\nTarget 2: Water & Sanitation infrastructure (Hand pumps) functioning \r\nIndicator 2: Spares for hand-pumps are sourced locally by project committees by end of 2010.', u"There are hardly any social and welfare facilities for the vulnerable in Mozambique. An estimated 54% of  inhabitants is suffering from extreme poverty.\r\n\r\nThe life expectancy in Mozambique is still below 50 years. Soon after the 14 years' civil war, the government had tried to repair the existing infra-structures which are mainly concentrated in the cities, but the poor people in the districts do not have access to these. \r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries of this project live in the districts Chemba and Marringue, located in the province of Sofala. Compared to national figures, the rural province of Sofala shows considerably lower scores when it comes to basic health situation. Under 5 mortality in Mozambique is 178 (out of 1.000) while in Sofala 205 children out of 1.000 will dy before their 5th birthday. \r\n\r\nAnother striking example: 45% of people have acces to sanitation in Mozambique, but in Sofala only 29% enjoy the basic and necessary 'luxury' of a simple latrine.
