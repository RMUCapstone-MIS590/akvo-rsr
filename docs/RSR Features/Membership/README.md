Registration

In order to participate actively within the RSR community, a user must have an account confirmed by an email handshake.

Registration for Akvo RSR is possible from any Akvo RSR page by clicking on the [Register](http://rsr.akvo.org/accounts/register1/) link in the Header.

In order to register a member of the public has to identify themselves as belonging to an existing ``organisation`` within RSR. To register an ``organisation`` check out the [criteria for RSR Partners](http://akvo.org/criteria-roles-and-procedures-for-akvo-partners/).

Once an organisation has become a partner, the Partner Team create the ``organisation`` using the Admin and this is then available in the organisation list.

On the next stage, the user is required to pick a unique ``username`` for their account as well as complete some basic information.

- First and Last Name
- Password
- Email Address

Once this step is completed, the user will be sent an activation link via email.

HANDY HINT: The URL of step 2 of the Registration process is ``organisation`` encoded, meaning it's possible to direct users to the registration 'portal' of a particular organisation should you choose to. E.g. For Akvo (OrgId=42) http://rsr.akvo.org/accounts/register2/?org_id=42.
