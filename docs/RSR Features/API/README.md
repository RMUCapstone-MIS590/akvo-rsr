In addition to the manual interaction methods in RSR, we have built a data API that allows you to interface directly with the information stored in the database in 2 different ways.

### Visualising Data using the RSR API

Firstly, we offer the ability to READ all of your data directly. The API provides information in JSON or XML format that can be parsed and implemented directly into a Website or data store. This allows your data to be displayed in any custom format you wish. Additionally you can choose to display, all or part of the available information with no impact on the data entry or maintenance processes.

We are already working with this solution for some time. You can find a list of our Live Partners using this solution here: [API Partners](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/master/docs/RSR%20Features/API/API-Read-Partners.md).

If you are interested in using the READ API for displaying your RSR Projects in your Site or Page, please check out our [Technical API Documentation](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/master/docs/RSR%20Features/API/Akvo-RSR-API-developer-documentation.md).

In addition to the API Technical Documentation, we're also working on expanding the list of customised resources created with specific data sets to be visualised. This work is captured within our [API Resources documentation](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/master/docs/RSR%20Features/API/API-Resources.md).


### Creating Data using the RSR API

Secondly we have created the ability for Partners to be able to export their project information directly from their Internal Project Management System and import this directly into RSR using the API.

This product is still being improved and fine-tuned, but it is Live and is available to use.

The file specification and requirements are documented and can be found [in this folder](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/tree/master/docs/RSR%20Features/API/downloads).

We have also documented some of the specific Partner customisations for our implementations within these pages:

- [Cordaid Foundation NL](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/master/docs/RSR%20Features/API/API-Write---Cordaid-Implementation.md)()
- [RAIN Foundation NL](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/blob/master/docs/RSR%20Features/API/API-Write-RAIN-Implementation.md)

At present this option requires a full implementation project with responsibilities from all parties involved. If you would like to find out more about what this involves and if this is available for your Organisation, please contact us at support@akvo.org.
