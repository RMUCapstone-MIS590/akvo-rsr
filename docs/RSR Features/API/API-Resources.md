## API Resources

In order to make calls to the API for commonly used features, we have started to create cusotmised resources to provide the exact information that is needed.

#### Project Update Resource

We have created a resource to encapsulate all the information required to read and display a Project Update within a website or other visual interface.

http://rsr.akvo.org/api/v1/project_update_extra/?format=json
