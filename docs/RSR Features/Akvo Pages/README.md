Akvo Pages (Formerly known as Partnersites) allow Partners to visualise their projects within a pre-build set of RSR pages. These can be used as a standalone website covering an organisation's projects on the platform, or it can be integrated into an existing website.

The standard URL for an implementation is http://organisationname.akvoapp.org.

We also offer the ability for partners to use a CNAME redirect to allow further integration into their websites. This could be something like http://projects.organisationwebsite.org.
