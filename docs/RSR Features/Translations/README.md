## Translations

We have 2 tranlsation options in RSR. One of them is an automatic translation service provided by Google Tranlsate using a Widget displayed on pages. The second is a manual translation of the user interface that is managed using Transifex and a team of translators.

### Google Translate Widget

You can turn this on and off via the Admin in the Partnersite settings.

### Manual UI Translations

We have the option to change the language of the user interface into:

- English
- French
- Dutch
- German
- Spanish
- Russian

#### Update Process

The process to update the translations involves creating a .po file from the RSR system and uploading this into Transifex. From there the strings are available for our translators to check and enter the new strings in the local languages.

When we have new translations to be made we need to reach out to the translators to provide the new strings.

Once completed, we will need to collect the new files and load them back into RSR before the new information is available.

#### Translators

We have worked with a team of independent tranlsators to provide the current languages in RSR.
