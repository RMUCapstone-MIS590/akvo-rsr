Setup local dev repositories
----------------------------
1)  Create a dev folder for your local repositories, e.g. ~/Dropbox/dev/akvo

2)  For RSR development, clone the http://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr repository:
      git clone git@github.com:akvo/akvo-rsr.git

    NB: if you get any permissions errors, ensure you've followed http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git
        and the rest of the details in the 1_dev_tools_setup_for_osx.txt file.

3)  If you've just cloned the repository, initialise it with git flow.
    From the repo directory, run:
        git flow init

    When prompted, use the default values, *except* for the Version tag prefix, which is "v":
    
      Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
          - master
        Branch name for production releases: [master] 
        Branch name for "next release" development: [develop] 

        How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
        Feature branches? [feature/] 
        Release branches? [release/] 
        Hotfix branches? [hotfix/] 
        Support branches? [support/] 
        Version tag prefix? [] v

4)  After git flow initialisation, you'll be in the develop branch.  To start development, create a new
    feature branch with:
        git flow feature start shiny_new_feature
    This will create a new branch off the develop branch called: feature/shiny_new_feature

    You can now start coding in your feature branch and, when ready, push the finished work to
    the develop branch with:
        git flow feature finish shiny_new_feature

5)  To use this repository with Github for Mac:
    a)  If you're using Github for Mac for the first time, follow the prompts to set your Github details
        and to locate any existing git repositories on your file system.
    b)  If you've already been using the Github app, go to:
          Preferences -> Repositories -> Scan for repositories
        to add the repository you've just cloned.
