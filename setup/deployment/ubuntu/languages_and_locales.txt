Locale and languages setup:
---------------------------

Note: these instructions can be followed if the locale packages or settings become broken at any point and you start seeing warnings
      like these when you try to install/upgrade system packages:

          perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
          perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
             LANGUAGE = (unset),
             LC_ALL = (unset),
             LC_CTYPE = "en_GB.UTF-8",
             LANG = "en_GB.US-ASCII"
             are supported and installed on your system.
          perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").


1)  Install the English language pack:
      sudo aptitude install language-pack-en-base

2)  Edit or create /var/lib/locales/supported.d/en and replace with the following content:
      en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
      en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8

3)  Edit or create /etc/default/locale and use the following:
      LANG="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LANGUAGE="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_CTYPE="en_GB.UTF-8"

4)  Install the locales system package:
      sudo aptitude install locales

    Note: if you see perl warnings as in the note above this will be fixed when re-installing the locales package in step 7

5)  Generate the configured locales:
      sudo locale-gen

6)  Reboot (with: sudo reboot)

7)  Reinstall and reconfigure the locales package:
      sudo aptitude install locales
      sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

8)  Run "locale" and check that you get output similar to this, without any errors or warnings:
      LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
      LANGUAGE=en_GB.UTF-8
      LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8
      LC_NUMERIC="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_TIME="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_COLLATE="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_MONETARY="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_MESSAGES="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_PAPER="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_NAME="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_ADDRESS="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_TELEPHONE="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_MEASUREMENT="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_GB.UTF-8"
      LC_ALL=
