 RELEASE_NOTES.txt, v0.9.1, 9 February 2009, bw

Akvo RSR (Really Simple Reporting) is part of the Akvo Platform. The
Akvo Platform is used on Akvo.org to combat poverty through
small-scale water and sanitation projects. We believe that Akvo RSR
can be used in many other development aid scenarios, in areas such as
education, health care, agriculture, etc.

Akvo RSR v 0.9.1 release notes
=============================
v0.9.1, 9 February 2009, bw

New features
------------
- Django framework upgrade. 
This version of Akvo RSR uses the latest Django framework, version
1.0.2. The new form-handling library, django.forms, was designed with
extensibility and customization in mind, and will permit us to more
quickly and easily develop RSR's administration user interface. To
read more about Django 1.0 please see:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.0/

Parts of RSR have been rewritten to accomodate the frameworks
upgrade. RSR should not look or behave any differently than it did in
0.9. If you experience anything new, please let us know so we can
address problems!

- Internationalization.
Dutch translation files have been added. A big thanks to our Dutch
translator, Anke van Lenteren, for helping us as we work out our
translation process.

- Miscellaneous
The wording of some text and error messages has been changed in the
interest of greater clarity (and proper English). There are also some
minor tweaks to style sheets to fix display glitches and layout
irregularities across browsers.


Akvo RSR v 0.9 release notes
============================
v0.9, 8 January 2009, tbp

New features
------------
- First public release
This is the first public release of Akvo RSR. 

- Internationalization for the user interface.
We have tagged all the user interface text, so that the Django
translation engine can pick up the text strings and produce a
translation file. While the interface is translated, some emails from
the system remain in English; these will be fixed in a later
release. We have tested the implementation with one initial language,
German. You can participate and help translate the Akvo RSR user
interface to your language by downloading the translation files from:
https://translations.launchpad.net/akvo.rsr

- Licensing.
Inserted the GNU AGPL license in the distribution and tagged all the
files with license information.

- Akvo at a glance portlet.
Field partners, Support partners and Funding partners are now linked
to a listing showing only those partners (the feature existed before,
but there were no links to it).

- Project updates.
Projects with no updates now have an RSS icon and a link (previously
you had to wait for the first update for the icon and link to show
up). So you can subscribe with an RSS reader to projects which have
not been updated yet.

- We have changed how funders contributions are displayed in the
  Organisation activities portlet. Now only the funders proportion of
  a project is displayed (Bug 269400).
