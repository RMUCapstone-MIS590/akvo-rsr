RELEASE_NOTES.txt, v0.9.5, 20 April 2009, tbp

Akvo RSR (Really Simple Reporting) is part of the Akvo Platform. The
Akvo Platform is used on Akvo.org to combat poverty through
small-scale water and sanitation projects. We believe that Akvo RSR
can be used in many other development aid scenarios, in areas such as
education, health care, agriculture, etc.

Akvo RSR v 0.9.5 release notes
==============================
v0.9.5, 20 April 2009, (Code name: Juno) tbp

New required software: sorl-thumbnail.
For the image handling integration you now need the following software:
http://code.google.com/p/sorl-thumbnail/

New features
------------
- Akvo RSR image upload improvements
When uploading images to the Akvo RSR system there are now a number of
improvements to how the system handle images.

1) Images are scaled to the appropriate size the first time they are
viewed. This is done via the sorl-thumbnail toolkit.
2) Images are now renamed according to the use in the system. The
naming is based on
ModelName_instance.pk_FieldName_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.ext. Example: a
map image uploaded to project no 17 gets the name
Project_17_map_2009-04-17_12.13.14.jpg.
3) Images are stored in the subdirectory related to the project and
the update. /var/www/akvo/db/project/NN/update/MM

- Akvo RSR admin link
A link to the administration login can now be found on the footer of
the page "Admin". (Note, that if you are on the non-RSR pages of the
Akvo.org site, the Admin link leads to the Drupal system admin pages.)

Infrastructure
--------------
The file hierarcy has changed. To read more about it, check out the 
document: http://www.akvo.org/web/akvo-rsr-installation

Bugs

Fixed two bugs where the maxlength attribute was missing on the input
field for photo_credit and photo_caption.

Widgets and Paypal donations. (Thanks Anke and Malte!)

Akvo RSR v 0.9.3 release notes
==============================
v0.9.3, 12 March 2009, tbp

New required software: django-paypal. 
For the PayPal integration you now need the following software:
http://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal/

New features
------------
- Akvo RSR Widgets user interface
There is now a user interface to select and customize widgets. The
tool can be found under Page tools on each project page. The widgets
can be placed on any web site to promote a particular project or
highlight progress.

- Akvo RSR delegated project and user administration beta
We have started creating the ability for project owners to edit their
own project descriptions and manage their own users. The tools are
fairly basic so far, but it is a start.

- Akvo Direct PayPal integration, using django-paypal
Support added for making donations to projects via PayPal
Standard. Instances of a new PayPalInvoice class are created which
capture details of the payment and track it all the way through to
PayPal and back again. Invoices are "completed" and the end user is
sent a confirmation email on receipt of a confirmation callback from
PayPal.

Behaviour of PayPal donations can be defined by several environment
variables in settings.py, making it straightforward to select
currency, PayPal command flow, specify custom PayPal buttons and
switch between sandbox settings for testing and production settings.

Limitations in PayPal integration

There are a couple of limitations with the PayPal integration at this
point.

Donation committments
When performing a donation we committ a portion of the funding the
project needs, to ensure that the project isn't overfunded. We
currently have no routines to take down "stale" donations,
i.e. donations which were never completed. This is a priority set of
routines which will be created as soon as possible.

PayPal charges
Project funding is currently done as integers. This will have to
change, as when donations come in from PayPal a certain percentage of
the donation has been deducted from the donation. This very seldom is
a whole number. We don't deduct this at this point from the project,
which means that the project will always be short of some funds if
donations have been made to it. This is a fairly large thing to fix,
so due to deadlines we have punted this for a later release. Each
transaction that is completed has a record of how much PayPal charged,
so we can fix the accounting later.


Infrastructure
--------------
The way funding of a project was calculated has been changed. We have
included the donations into the funding.

Bugs
----
Fixed a bug in the project-list widget. When you sorted on anything
else than project name it was impossible to resort on project name.


Akvo RSR v 0.9.2 release notes
==============================
v0.9.2, 13 February 2009, tbp

New feature
-----------
- Akvo RSR Widgets
Beta-release of the Akvo RSR Widget backend. This allows you to post
iFrame based widgets of projects and project listings. A user
interface should be added to the next release.

Akvo RSR v 0.9.1 release notes
=============================
v0.9.1, 9 February 2009, bw

New features
------------
- Django framework upgrade. 
This version of Akvo RSR uses the latest Django framework, version
1.0.2. The new form-handling library, django.forms, was designed with
extensibility and customization in mind, and will permit us to more
quickly and easily develop RSR's administration user interface. To
read more about Django 1.0 please see:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.0/

Parts of RSR have been rewritten to accomodate the frameworks
upgrade. RSR should not look or behave any differently than it did in
0.9. If you experience anything new, please let us know so we can
address problems!

- Internationalization.
Dutch translation files have been added. A big thanks to our Dutch
translator, Anke van Lenteren, for helping us as we work out our
translation process.

- Miscellaneous
The wording of some text and error messages has been changed in the
interest of greater clarity (and proper English). There are also some
minor tweaks to style sheets to fix display glitches and layout
irregularities across browsers.


Akvo RSR v 0.9 release notes
============================
v0.9, 8 January 2009, tbp

New features
------------
- First public release
This is the first public release of Akvo RSR. 

- Internationalization for the user interface.
We have tagged all the user interface text, so that the Django
translation engine can pick up the text strings and produce a
translation file. While the interface is translated, some emails from
the system remain in English; these will be fixed in a later
release. We have tested the implementation with one initial language,
German. You can participate and help translate the Akvo RSR user
interface to your language by downloading the translation files from:
https://translations.launchpad.net/akvo.rsr

- Licensing.
Inserted the GNU AGPL license in the distribution and tagged all the
files with license information.

- Akvo at a glance portlet.
Field partners, Support partners and Funding partners are now linked
to a listing showing only those partners (the feature existed before,
but there were no links to it).

- Project updates.
Projects with no updates now have an RSS icon and a link (previously
you had to wait for the first update for the icon and link to show
up). So you can subscribe with an RSS reader to projects which have
not been updated yet.

- We have changed how funders contributions are displayed in the
  Organisation activities portlet. Now only the funders proportion of
  a project is displayed (Bug 269400).
