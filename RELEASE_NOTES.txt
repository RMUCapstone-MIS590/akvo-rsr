Akvo RSR v 0.9 release notes
============================

Akvo RSR (Really Simple Reporting) is part of the Akvo Platform. The
Akvo Platform is used on Akvo.org to combat poverty through
small-scale water and sanitation projects. We believe that Akvo RSR
can be used in many other development aid scenarios like: education,
health care, agriculture projects etc.

New features 
------------ 
- First public release THIS is the first public release of Akvo RSR.

- Internationalization for the user interface.  
We have tagged all the user interface text, so that the Django
translation engine can pick up the text strings and produce a
translation file. While the interface is translated, some emails from
the system remain in English; these will be fixed in a later relese.
We have tested the implementation with one initial language,
German. You can participate and help translate the Akvo RSR user
interface to your language by downloading the translation files from:
https://translations.launchpad.net/akvo.rsr

- Licensing.
Inserted the GNU AGPL license in the distribution and tagged all the
files with license information.

- Akvo at a glance portlet
Field partners, Support partners and Funding partners are now linked
to a listing showing only those partners (the feature existed before,
but there were no links to it).

- Project updates 
Projects with no updates now have an RSS icon and a link (previously
you had to wait for the first update for the icon and link to show
up). So you can subscribe with an RSS reader to projects which have
not been updated yet.

- (Bug 269400) We have changed how funders contributions are displayed
  in the Organisation activities portlet. Now only the funders
  proportion of a project is displayed.
